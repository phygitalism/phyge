contained in a ﬁnal section  spectral density mc calculationswe consider the su wilson actionsp with sp s xptable  data and their reweighting rangessubsequent analysis of autocorrelation times shows that for our present data the choiceq   was too optimistic however this does not really matter because the mainpurpose of calculating βmin βmax intervals ﬁrst is to prevent reweighting calculations atabsurd β valuesin spin systems it is convenient to work with histograms for lattice gauge theories the action varies typically over a continuous range and a histogram method is notrecommendable for two reasonsi the size of the histogram bin ie of the action interval deemed to constitute a singlehistogram entry is an extraneous parameter it is tedious to have to cope with itii whatever the size of the bin inevitably part of the information contained in theoriginal sample gets lostinstead of artiﬁcially introducing histograms it is more convenient to rely directly on theempirical time series for the data this requires to keep all measurements on disk or tapein our present simulations we kept in double precision the spacelike and timelike plaquetteexpectation values and the real and imaginary polyakov loop values this amounts toup to     real data per l βi simulation point altogether ﬁlling up about gigabyte of disk space in unformatted storage consequently the feasibility of thiskind of analysis is tightly linked to the recent progress in storage technology and to theavailability of large disksto cover a larger β range one has to patch mc results from runs at diﬀerent βi valuesβi+  βi i    p  whose validity ranges overlapsi+q  siq  si+q  siqvarious methods can be found in the literature  the two recent discussions both aim at minimizing the errors in the resultant estimates for ns a crucial diﬀerenceis that  ﬁxes the needed relative normalizations of the histograms from data in theoverlap regions only whereas  exploits a selfconsistency condition which was previouslystated in  the approach  yields results even if there is no overlap at all whereas cannot be applied in such a situation for our purposes results from patches withoutoverlap are assumed to be meaningless and applying the selfconsistency condition maybe somewhat dangerous for histograms with strong overlaps both methods will convergetowards identical resultsmore generally it is useful to patch in such a way that the error of the actually calculated quantity is minimized this leads to the following very straightforward approachwhich we present in a form suitable for the time series analysis of our data the ﬁrstobservation is that any combinationiii for connected estimatorsσthat direct calculation of the integrated autocorrelation time gives for large nb a muchnoisier estimator than we obtain from multiple binning the enlargement of the ﬁrst partof ﬁgure  in its upper left corner demonstrates this most clearly presumably binned dataare favourably decorrelated consequently we now rely on multiple binning for evenlarger nb small number of bins nb also the error bars of σkdata sets these results are included in table  by deﬁning the number of independentindep measurements as the number of measurements divided by ˆτint one has tocaution that in the case of l    original measurements we can only rely onnb   bins for estimating ˆτint this means an error of about   around the centervalue and no consistency checks towards higher k values the l   estimates may beunreliable altogether however for our subsequent purposes the achieved overall accuracyseems to be suﬃcient

physical relevance of partition function zeros their numerical calculation was pioneered in refs of which  are concernedwith su lattice gauge theory in spin systems the action takes discrete values and thepartition function becomes a polynomial in expβ under such circumstances  thenewtonraphson method is convenient to calculate the partition function zeros whenthe action takes continuous values a time series analysis is more recommendable and wecalculate the partition function zeros in two steps ﬁrst we scan graphically  for theseparate zeros of the real and imaginary part figure  illustrates this for our   lattice at β   rez   is denoted by the crosses and imz   by the circlesa partition function zero is obtained when the lines cross second to compute the precisevalue for the leading zero we then iterate with amoeba  with starting values in asuﬃciently small neighborhood of the zerobefore we can present our su results we have to clarify some subtle details forsmaller su lattices we noted in  that our empirical action distributions are welldescribed by gaussian ﬁts however a gaussian distribution does not give rise to zerosin the complex β plane nevertheless we have reported zeros in  to resolve thisparadoxical situation we ﬁrst study gaussian random numbers and proceed then with theanalysis of our su action distributions the gaussian distributionassume a lattice

number generator and generate mc dataaccording to the probability density  subsequently a reweighting analysis is doneto determine the zeros for  and  independent data respectively ﬁgures and  compare the exact values for the leading zeros of imz and rez with thosefrom the simulation using equation  the expected range of validity for the numericalresults is also indicated and found to be respected by the data namely the apparentcrossings zeros of the partition function are seen to fall outside the conﬁdence radiusin the gaussian case we know for sure that this means they are numerical fakes for oursu  data we shall therefore have to reject any zeros which fall outside the conﬁdenceradiustable  patching of partition function zeros su resultsfor single runs our leading partition function zeros are collected in table  to estimatewhether they are inside or outside the conﬁdence radii deﬁned by equation  we usexs from table  as width of a ﬁctitious gaussian distribution thisand βmaxvalues reported in table  an example of a zero and itsthe estimated number of independent measurements from table  for instance  for the   lattices and σleads to the βmaxconﬁdence radius is given in ﬁgure  also showing the deﬁnition of βmaxan asterix in table  indicates that the estimated zero lies actually outside the radiusof conﬁdence we see that for the   l lattices most results have problems the issueis actually quite subtle as repetitions with similar statistics lead to reproducible resultsxyand βmaxythe reason is that for βx  β and a gaussian distribution zβy falls oﬀ exponentiallywith increasing βy as soon as the statistical noise becomes large enough this leads withcertainty to a fake crossover of real and imaginary zeros as illustrated in ﬁgures  and upon a closer inspection of table  one may argue that the   β   data set hasalso a problem however for the lt   distributions we have a pronounced double peakstructure and the use of σs from table  is not justiﬁed each of the single gaussianshas a much smaller width leading to conﬁdence radii larger than those reported in table to rescue some of our estimates for the   l lattices we appeal to our patchingmethod the

because of the normalization of ωxtable  shows the results of the standard error propagation analysis as applied tothe valid results in table  since the    lattices yield no valid results there is no  entry in table  like for the speciﬁc heat the data sets for l    lt   give poorestimates of βmax and the error on lχmax is large for l   again patching withweights given by eq b where we put fi  pi

consistent with those estimated from the analysisof the speciﬁc heat cf eq  and of the partition function zeros cf eq β suscfor lt   is rather small and becomes only consistent on a two σ level cf eqs  this may indicate that with our statistics presumably due to long timecorrelations the polyakov susceptibility is not accurate enough to allow really precise ﬁts summary and conclusionsspectral density methods greatly facilitate accurate fss calculations one can calculate pseudocritical couplings precisely and extrapolate towards the inﬁnite volume criticalcoupling from the speciﬁc heat the analysis of the partition function zeros and thepolyakov loop susceptibilities we have obtained three estimates of the inﬁnite volume critical β which diﬀer somewhat due to remaining systematic errors in the absence of otherstrong criteria one may average these estimates weighted by their error bars and quote asthe ﬁnal error the best error bar of the single estimates one can not use error propagationas all results are obtained from the same conﬁgurations in this way we obtain from  and and from   and βc    lt  βc    lt  the achieved accuracy improves estimates from the pioneering literature  by one orderof magnitude in the error bar translating to two orders of magnitude in computer timeanother notable result are the latent heats  and  which are consistent withindependent results by other groups  again the spectral density fss approach worksquite well the possibility to calculate a latent heat and similarly an order parameterjump selfconsistently is in our opinion the strongest argument in favour of the ﬁrst ordernature of this phase transition whereas for lt   one observes additionally a cleardouble peak structure the lt   transition is fairly weak and a double peak structurebegins marginally only to develop from l   on it is remarkable that the fss behavioris nevertheless already quite indicative for the ﬁrst order nature this seems to be drivenby the increase of the width of the almost gaussian looking action density distributionfor lt   the analysis of the partition function zeros has turned out to be moresubtle than previously anticipated nevertheless from l   on the results seem to beconclusive and the obtained estimate  of the critical exponent ν is consistent withν  d d   and rounds the picture of a weak ﬁrst order transition for lt  the same analysis is fairly unproblematic and the results of  are nicely improved andconﬁrmed the lt   estimate  for ν is of course consistent with a ﬁrst ordertransitionacknowledgementsthe mc data

    "text": "introductionin a recent paper  it was shown that string theory has a rich variety of solutionsdescribing extended objects surrounded by event horizons in particular there are blackstring solutions in ten dimensions characterized by three parameters the mass and axioncharge per unit length and the asymptotic value of the dilaton these solutions wereobtained by solving the low energy string equations of motion although this is suﬃcientto establish the existence of exact solutions with these qualitative features it was not clearhow to construct directly the conformal ﬁeld theory with these propertieswitten has recently shown  that a simple gauged wzw model  yields a twodimensional black hole this raises the possibility of using similar constructions to ﬁndexact conformal ﬁeld theories corresponding to higher dimensional black holes or extendedblack holes the conformal ﬁeld theory associated with an extremal limit of the chargedblack ﬁvebranes has recently been found  in this paper we will show that a simpleextension of wittens construction yields three dimensional charged black strings thesesolutions are also characterized by three parameters the mass m and axion charge qper unit length and a constant k related to the asymptotic value of the derivative of thedilaton the low energy metric antisymmetric tensor and dilaton take the formds  cid malthough the three dimensional black strings are most naturally described in terms ofthe string metric the metric appearing in the sigma model it is also of interest to considerthe rescaled einstein metric with the standard einsteinhilbert action we will see thatthe einstein metric also describes a black string in an asymptotically ﬂat spacetime but itis not static there is still a timelike symmetry outside the event horizon but it resemblesa boost at inﬁnity rather than a time translation derivation of black string solutionswe now describe the conformal ﬁeld theory construction which yields the black stringssince our target space is going to have lorentz signature we will use a lorentz metricds  dσ+dσ on the world sheet σ if g is an element of a group g then the ungaugedwesszuminowitten action can be writtenklg this gives the ungauged actionklg  and an antisymmetric tensor ﬁeldbtx  rit will be convenient to ﬁx the scaling of ˆr so that the dilaton is exactly φ  ln r + solutions φ depends only on k so to calculate their mass we do not need to include aperturbation of φ we need only perturb the metric gµν  ηµν + γµν integrating thetimetime component of the linearized form of eq  over a spacelike surface yields thefollowing formula for the total massmtot with q  m  the metric components are ill deﬁned at r   and r  r  m palong the string at inﬁnity becomes timelike inside the inner horizon equivalently thetime coordinate in region i of ﬁg  is t the time coordinate in region ii is r and the timecoordinate in region v is x for this reason it is not possible to represent all aspects of thecausal structure by a two dimensional diagram nevertheless most features are faithfullyindicated by ﬁg  with r+  m and r  qm  each point now represents a line inspacetime however it is the line in the x direction for r  qm and in the t direction forr  qm  unlike reissnernordstrom the black string solution also contains the regionslabeled vii and viii in ﬁg  which correspond to naked singularities this is becausethese regions correspond to r   or uv   + λ which is certainly part of the originalgauged wzw modelwe now consider geodesics in the black string solutions this is particularly simpledue to the two conserved quantities associated with the two translational symmetries letξµ be tangent to an aﬃnely parametrized geodesic and let e  ξ  t p  ξ  xdenote the conserved quantities then geodesics satisfyk rand  the resolution is that geodesics with p   cross the point labeled p in ﬁg recall this is really a line in spacetime at p the killing vector x is not only null butactually vanisheswe have seen that the three dimensional black string is qualitatively very similar to thereissnernordstrom solution this analogy appears to extend to hawking evaporationwe can deﬁne a hawking temperature for the black string by analytically continuingt  iτ in eq  the horizon r  m is a regular point only if we identify τ with periodπmpone can easily verify that geodesics now cross the horizon r   from positive to negativevalues of r so the metric  and not  describes the correct extension across thehorizon but the region r   is identical to the region r   and the metric  isnonsingular nevertheless r   is still an event horizon thus one has the unusualsituation of a spacetime with an event horizon but no singularity the global structureis described in ﬁg  observers in this spacetime who cross the event horizon are not ableto return but fortunately for them ﬁnd themselves in another asymptotically ﬂat regionof spacetime which is identical to the one they started inwhat happens to the region v in ﬁg  near the singularity as q approaches m setting r  m  r the metric in this region becomesds rﬁelds outside of a fundamental macroscopic string dabholkar et al also found the ﬁeldsoutside of a fundamental macroscopic string in any dimension in three dimensions theirsolution isds limit m   q   keeping qm  m ﬁxed one ﬁnds that  reduces to exactly theproduct of dt and the two dimensional euclidean black hole discussed in ref this insight helps us to resolve another aspect of these solutions the conformal ﬁeldtheory construction described in the previous section only yields the solutions  withq  m  however the ﬁelds  with q  m also solve the low energy string equationsand its natural to ask what is the exact conformal ﬁeld theory that they correspond tothe answer is a slight modiﬁcation of the construction in sec  one again starts withsl r  r but now puts a timelike metric on r one then gauges a translation of rtogether with the subgroup of sl r generated by cid cid the result is exactlythe solutions  with q  m  in the limit that r is not gauged one obtains the twodimensional euclidean black hole cross dtinvestigations of the two dimensional euclidean black hole have shown that this nonsingular space is dual to the euclidean negative mass solution which has a curvature singularity  in other words these two diﬀerent geometries are equivalentas conformal ﬁeld theories although this sounds intriguing the physical interpretationof this result remains unclear the reason is that in the euclidean context the dualityinvolves string winding modes in euclidean timein the lorentzian context both theoriginal conformal ﬁeld theory and its dual contain all six regions of the black hole so thespacetime metric does not change at all in three dimensions there is an analog of thisduality with a clear physical interpretation and a rather striking conclusion by the usualtwo dimensional arguments the spacetimeds  dt +cid m conclusionswe have been describing the black string solutions in terms of the metric which appearsin the sigma model this is the metric that the strings couple directly to and is the mostnatural one to use in string theory however to compare with results in general relativityit is sometimes useful to rescale this string metric by a power of the dilaton to obtain ametric with the standard einstein action since conformal transformations do not changethe causal structure both the original string metric and the new einstein metric willhave the same horizons but since the dilaton is growing linearly at inﬁnity one mightthink that the einstein metric will not be asymptotically ﬂat this is incorrect in threedimensions the einstein metric gµν is related to the string metric by gµν  eφgµν thusasymptotically the einstein metric approachesds  rdt + dx +ksimilar to the reissnernordstrom solution they have an event horizon an inner horizonand a timelike singularity when q  m the spacetime has an event horizon but nosingularity another way to take the extremal limit which does not preserve the boundaryconditions yields antide sitter spacetime when q  m  both the horizon and thecurvature singularity disappear to avoid a conical singularity one must compactify oneof the directions a limiting case yields just the product of time and the two dimensionaleuclidean black holesince our black string solutions are three dimensional and have a linear dilaton at inﬁnity they presumably are not of direct physical interest their importance is twofold firstthey illustrate that a wide range of causal structures including some having no analog ingeneral relativity can occur in string theory indeed we ﬁnd it surprising that a simpleconformal ﬁeld theory construction can result in such nontrivial spacetime structure thisencourages the hope that an exact conformal ﬁeld theory describing higher dimensionalblack holes and black strings will soon be found second like the two dimensional blackhole they provide an important test of whether gravitational collapse will lead to singularities in string theory it has been shown that string theory does have exact solutionswhich are singular  however the known singular solutions do not have event horizonsand hence do not describe gravitational collapseit is still not clear whether the two dimensional black hole is singular in string theoryrecall that although one has an exact description of the conformal ﬁeld theory in terms ofa gauged wzw model the spacetime metric  is only the lowest order approximationto the geometry higher order corrections can be large near the singularity it has beenargued  that even though the conformal ﬁeld theory may be regular at r   it doesnot make sense to consider signals propagating from r   to r   for two reasons oneis that in the two dimensional black hole the surface r   is spacelike on one side andtimelike on the other thus if signals can propagate across there would appear to bea violation of causality the other is that r   appears to be unstable in that genericperturbations blow up there for our three dimensional black strings with   q  m the surface r   is timelike on both sides so no causality problems should arise on theother hand general arguments suggest that the inner horizon r  qm is now unstableso once again it appears to be impossible to propagate signals from

diﬀeomorphisms of a certain three manifoldthe spin  brst invariant operators generate a commutative associative ringfor the following reason let o and o be two such operators the operator productozo is brst invariant so all the terms in its short distance expansion forz   are brst invariant negative powers of z may arise in this short distanceexpansion but the operators multiplying the negative powers of z are negativedimension operators which must be brst commutators as there is no brstcohomology at negative dimension in this theory therefore modulo the brstcommutators the short distance limit of ozo is some brst invariant spinzero operator o which may vanishozo  o + q   this is the desired multiplication law o  o  o this procedure obviouslydeﬁnes a commutative associative ringby combining left and right movers in the usual way we can form spin  quantum ﬁeld operatorsvunn  ounmodulo brst commutators where c is any contour surrounding the point p standard contour manipulations show that if j and j are two currents and j jis their commutator thenj jop   jjop   jjop so that the op s form a representation of the symmetry algebra what is moreunusual is that since a contour

js act as derivations of the ring of os these considerations can beapplied in two diﬀerent ways the chiral currents w sn act as derivations of thechiral ground ring and the quantum currents j andnow let us combine left and right movers to make the full quantum groundring it is generated by operators xnymxnwith n + m  n + m to balancethe liouville momenta such operators are multiplied in the obvious way byymmultiplying the left and right moving parts separately at n + m   there is onlythe identity operator at n + m   there are four operatorsa  xxa  yya  xya  yxthe ground ring is generated by the ai since any monomial xnymxnwithn + m  n + m can obviously be written as a monomial in the ai the ai obeythe one obvious relationymaa  aa  and are otherwise independent in algebraic geometry one says that the left handside of  is a homogeneous polynomial whose zeros form a quadric in p andthe equations  are an isomorphism of this quadric with p  pthus the ground ring of the theory at the su point is the ring of polynomial functions on the three dimensional quadric cone q deﬁned by aaaa  in comparing with matrix models we will learn that the three dimensions of thiscone correspond to the matrix eigenvalue its canonical momentum and the timeof the matrix model schodinger equation at the su point there is a completesymmetry among these variables which is partly lost upon decompactiﬁcation determination of the chiral symmetry algebranow we will determine the symmetry algebra of the theory by using the factthat it acts as an algebra of derivations of the ground ring first we consider thechiral currentsto determine how a chiral current j acts on the chiral ground ring it is enoughfrom  to know what it does to x and y indeed ifjx  f x y and jy  gx ythen it follows from  that for an arbitrary element wx y of the ground ringwe getjw  cidfthe action of w + on y is given by the residue of the pole which is  sow +y  on the other hand w +the operator product w + annihilates x there is no short distance singularity in  x hence we have determined that w + actson the chiral ground ring asw + momentum values and as they are the only cohomology classes with their valuesof the ghost number and liouville momentum they form an su representationwhich must have spin  thus without further ado we havew +  xthat generates an inﬁnitesimal areapreserving transformation of the x  y planeif we identify w +sn with the transformation determined by the vector ﬁeld thatcorresponds to hx y  xs+nysn then all of the conditions are obeyed since ithese w s are nonzero ii this assignment is su or sl ir covariant iiithese w s obviously generate a lie algebra the area preserving diﬀeomorphismsof the x  y plane are therefore the lie algebra that we are looking forit remains to show that for any s the w +sn act nontrivially on x and yfirst let us note that for any s by counting the liouville momenta the commutator w +sn+n moreover for given s thesefor n   and n  s one hassn is a multiple of w +indeedn w +commutators are not all zerow +  eix+φthe other operators w +calculation is just analogous to the one above for w +tators w +ss the commun w sn  w s+n+n are all determined by su in terms on oneunknown s dependent coeﬃcient which is nonzero for all s in view of what wasjust said this being so the w sn can be uniquely normalized so as to transformunder w +n as claimed in  the derivatives of δx y appearing in give a representation of the algebra of polynomial areapreserving vector ﬁelds soto prove that the w sn transform as claimed it is enough to show that there isonly one possible representation in which the w +sn for s   act as claimed thisn w +is an immediate consequence of the formula w +sn+n whichcombined with su invariance uniquely determines the action of the w +sn oncethe action of the w +sn  w +sn is knownthe w sn act trivially on the x y plane this can be demonstrated by considering the liouville momentum and su transformations as above the quantum symmetry algebranow we will combine the left and right movers and determine the quantumsymmetry algebra that is the algebra of the operators introduced earlier in jsnn  w +snh such that on hλ  df  θwhere λ  dadadada is up to a constant multiple the unique translation andsl invariant volume form on the ambient aﬃne space the latter descriptionmakes it possible to deﬁne θ without singling out one of the coordinates for thequadric q f  aa  aa sodadadaθ have spin s s   and s   s for s        moreover the vector ﬁeldscorresponding to the jsnn andcorresponds to the case φ  µ a constant thus according to our ansatz theground ring at µ   but still at the su radius is the ring of functions on thesmooth quadricaa  aa  µthus conjecturally to ﬁrst order the hypersurface q can be deformed toan arbitrary nearby aﬃne hypersurface in the ambient fourspace however thegeneral deformation will be obstructed in second order by a nonzero beta functionthis can be computed as follows  consider a general theory with left andright moving currents ja andand φ as they coincide on q as will be explained in the appendix there is alwaysa unique choice of f such that φ   it is easy to see that if φ is a homogenouspolynomial so zφ  λφ for some λ such that φ   and φ is a solution of β  then wφ is also a solution of β   for any function w the simplest nonconstantfunction obeying the stated conditions is φ  aa + aa consequently sincein fact φ  aa on q the uncompactiﬁed theory comparison to the matrix modelwe now want to consider the uncompactiﬁed string theory henceforth therefore x will be real valued rather than circle valued of course this is the casethat is best understood from the point of view of matrix modelsof the operators that we have found in  the ones that survive in the uncompactiﬁed theory are the ones that have pl  pr   where pl and pr are the leftand right moving momenta recalling the deﬁnitionsa  xxa  yya  xya  yxand noting that the pl pr values arex   now let us determine the symmetry group of the uncompactiﬁed model thisis simply the subgroup of the group of volumepreserving diﬀeomorphisms of thequadric cone q which are also k invariant we recall from  that the volumeform in these coordinates isθ  dψ da daa general k invariant vector ﬁeld is of the formf a aimmediately sees thatcidftions of the threemanifold  correspond to area preserving diﬀeomorphismsof the a  a plane that map the locus h   to itself plus the abelian gaugetransformations u ψ this would be expected if h corresponds to the one bodyhamiltonian of the matrix model in particular according to the ansatz when thecosmological constant is turned on the hypersurface aa  aa   is deformedto a hypersurface qµ given by aa  aa  µ a k invariant volume preservingdiﬀeomorphism of qµ is an area preserving diﬀeomorphism of the a  a planethat leaves ﬁxed the curve aa  µ   this curve corresponds to the fermisurface of the matrix model at chemical potential µ symmetries of the matrix modellet us now analyze the symmetries of the matrix model version of the c  theory our discussion will be fairly similar to that of   but we willconsider a somewhat larger class of symmetries the extra symmetries might beconsidered trivial in the matrix model but are important in comparing to theconformal ﬁeld theoryconsider the lagrangian for a free particle moving in the p  q planethis can be writtenwhere α is the one forml  z dt p q  hp q l  z αα  p dq  h dta symmetry generator is an arbitrary inﬁnitesimal transformationδp  f p q tδq  gp q tδt  up q tthat leaves the lagrangian

apparent discrepancy it hasa very nice explanation in the matrix model the   and   currents thatwe found in the conformal ﬁeld theory are unbroken symmetries of a particularground state they should be compared to the symmetries of the matrix modelthat preserve the ground state the ground state of the matrix model is the statein which all the single particle levels of hp q   are ﬁlled and the others areempty an area preserving transformation that maps ﬁlled states to ﬁlled statesand empty states to empty states necessarily maps the fermi surface to itself ashp q  p  q  p  q the area preserving

ringelements  in the topological lg theory with potential  are given byhφµ    φµnig  f µ    µn g kβkifrt  n + m k +   gn mand are zero if the condition on rt is not satisﬁed where rt  pni rµi is thetotal form number the conjecture is that the coeﬃcients f µ    µn g k in the abovecorrelation function give the number of intersections of n surfaces in the moduli space ofdegree k instanton maps φ from genus g riemann surfaces into the grassmannian spaceu n + m u n u m  the ith surface is that obtained by requiring the instanton mapφ to satisfy φzi  σµi  where zi is the ith arbitrary point on the riemann surfaceand where σµi is a ﬁxed cycle in the grassmannian which is poincare dual to φµi egif φµ is the volume form then σµ is a point in the grassmannian the codimension ofthe ith surface is thus rµi the number of intersections of these surfaces counts thenumber of instanton maps of a given degree which satisfy the above conditions these arethe observables in the topological sigma modela check on the conjecture is that the relation for rt  the sum of the codimensionsof the intersected surfaces as given by simple charge counting in  in terms of k andg is the correct moduli space dimension it is also encouraging that since thef g k are the twisted verlinde dimensions for the rcft discussed above the f g k arenonnegative integersthe correlation functions  are calculated using  it is sometimes convenientas discussed in sect  to calculate in terms of the qi variablesin these variablesthe critical points are simply given by qi  αωni where ωn+m   and αn+m n β with ni      n + m and ni  ni+i      n  the zn+mstructure obtained above is obvious in these variables the operator h of  ish  nn n + m n qi qin+m  as an example the interested readercan easily verify our normalization hφˆcig  we now consider the n ie cp m  case the potential  isxm +w which is a nonnegative integer note that f g k +   f g k +  + f g k andf g +  k +   f g k it would be interesting to check the conjecture by directlycalculating the intersections in the moduli space of instantons for this spaceit wouldalso be interesting to connect this with the interpretation in terms of the twisted verlindedimensions conclusionswe have seen that rcft fusion rules which can be described as the chiral ring structure constants of some lg superpotential must have an extra symmetry correspondingto spectral ﬂow and that the correlation functions in the corresponding topological lgtheory give a twisted version of the rcfts verlinde dimensions the symmetry  ofthe rcft fusion rules also implies a symmetry of the deformed superpotential in bothof the perturbations considered here this symmetry appears to be connected with the factthat the perturbed theories are integrable it would be interesting to understand if thereis a general connection between the integrability of a perturbed superpotential and havingits ring give the fusion rules of a rational conformal ﬁeld theoryi would

    "text": "introductionthe study of quantum ﬁeld theory in + spacetime dimensions can provide importantinsight into the structure of quantum ﬁeld theory in general of particular interest arethe exactly solvable massive models which are integrable hamiltonian systems in manycases the exact onshell smatrices are known for some wellknown examples see  the exact form factors for some ﬁelds in many of the models have also been computed  despite the integrability of the models many of their important properties most notablytheir correlation functions remain unknownmore recently it has been recognized that the massive integrable quantum ﬁeld theoriesare to a large extent characterized by quantum group symmetries which can serve todeﬁne the theory nonperturbatively    the quantum group symmetry algebrasof interest are inﬁnite dimensional and nonabelian explicit currents that generate aqdeformation of aﬃne kacmoody algebras   were constructed in the sinegordontheory and its generalization to imaginary coupling aﬃne toda theory  and shown tocompletely characterize the smatrices at a speciﬁc value of the coupling constant wherethe theory is invariant with respect to a ﬁnite dimensional lie algebra g these theoriesare the grossneveu models and there the inﬁnite dimensional symmetry becomes theyangian of drinfeld which contains g as a subalgebra the nonlocal conserved currentsthat generate this symmetry were actually constructed some time ago by luscher however the connection of these currents to yangians was only recently recognized bybernard the existence of these inﬁnite dimensional symmetries leads to the idea that thesemodels may be solvable in the spirit that the conformal ﬁeld theories are solved   inthis methodology the emphasis is on how the ﬁelds realize inﬁnite dimensional vermamodule representations of the symmetry algebrain this work assuming the exact smatrix and its onshell symmetry for a generalmodel are given we describe how the symmetry can be extended oﬀshell to the space ofﬁelds we begin by deﬁning an adjoint action of the symmetry algebra on ﬁelds whichgeneralizes the notion of commutator one encounters for ordinary symmetries to an arbitrary quantum group symmetry form factors of descendent ﬁelds are shown to beexplicitly computable from the form factors of ancestor ﬁelds the braiding of ﬁelds inthe multiplets obtained by adjoint action is given by the universal rmatrix of the quantum group a result of this kind was also found for the ﬁnite dimensional quantum groupsymmetry of conformal ﬁeld theory by gomez and sierrathe example we develop in some detail which displays all of the interesting issuesinvolved is characterized by sl yangian symmetry as mentioned above these modelscan be formulated as the ginvariant grossneveu model   where g is here taken tobe sl this model can also be formulated in a way more suitable for our discussion asa massive currentcurrent perturbation of the ginvariant wesszuminowittennovikovwzwn model at level k   with the actions  slevel g+ gz dx j axcontrast for massive models if the symmetry algebra commutes with the particle numberoperator then the symmetry algebra must possess ﬁnite dimensional representations onthe space of particle states since the number of states at ﬁxed particle number is ﬁnitethus assuming that at least some of the representations of the kacmoody algebra canbe deformed into representations of the yangian the level must be zero however indistinction with conformal ﬁeld theory since there is not this correspondence betweenstates and ﬁelds in massive theory the ﬁelds of the theory may still form distinct inﬁnitedimensional representationsthis paper is organized as follows in the ﬁrst section we

between ﬁelds and states here the ﬁelds in the theory are completelydeﬁned by specifying their matrix elements in the space of states h ie their form factorslet us begin by reviewing some basic

the commutator withthe global conserved charges the jacobi identity ensures that ﬁelds related by this adjointaction fall into ﬁnite dimensional representations of the symmetry algebra it is this featurethat we now generalize to an arbitrary quantum group a  we deﬁne two adjoint actionson the space of ﬁeldsadea φx  µijadea φx  µija sei φx eja sej φx ei abthe signiﬁcance of the two diﬀerent adjoint actions will be explained shortly the adjointactions as we have deﬁned them are primarily characterized as being homomorphismsad ad  ahomo a φx amore preciselyadea adeb φx  mcab adec φx this follows from the fact that the comultiplication  is a homomorphism from a toa  a d  and from f  for elements a  a with the trivial comultiplicationa  a   +   a and counit εa   ada is just the usual commutatorrepeated adjoint action on a given ﬁeld φx generates a tower of its descendentsφxφxad φaax  φxad φaax  φxabthe form factors of any descendent of a ﬁeld φx are explicitly computable from knowledgeof the form factors for φx and the given action ρh of a on the space of multiparticlestates this is evident from the deﬁnition  where when computing the matrixelements of adea φx the elements of a to the right or left of the ﬁeld give a knowntransformation on statesby virtue of the symmetry of the smatrix  the descendent form factors satisfythe axiom  however they do not generally satisfy  hence descendents aregenerally not local ﬁelds this is due to the nonlocality of the conserved currents thatgenerate a  indeed as explained in  and similarly for conformal ﬁeld theories in the nontrivial comultiplication of a is due to the nonlocality of these currentsa highest weight ﬁeld is deﬁned as a ﬁeld which cannot be reached by adjoint actionon another ﬁeld a precise deﬁnition of highest weight ﬁeld requires a deﬁnition of raisingand lowering operators for the algebra a  or at least for its quantum double the towersof descendents  of a highest weight ﬁeld by construction ﬁll

thisstructure can be modiﬁed by introducing appropriate background charges whichdo not change the value of the total central charge ctot  older members of the family are the topological sigma models

ﬁxing ofa topological symmetrythe later models as well as the previous ones exhibit an important relationto noncritical string theories and their matrix models counterparts once they arecoupled to the topological two dimensional gravity  of eqn   for instancewhen a tsm is coupled to tg to produce a topological string model thecorresponding action is the sum of the actions given in eqn  and an interesting question is to what extent are ordinary critical and noncriticalstring theories both bosonic and supersymmetric a special case of tcftsapartfrom a comment in the last section we do not consider here string theories astcfts a unified picturetwo questions are now in order i can one unify the actions of the modelspresented in the last section and ii are there other topological models a straightforward observation is that for r   all the actions described in the previoussection are special cases of the following general actions  z dzxiφhi  φhi + ψhi  ψhi + ccwhere φhi ψhi are commuting and anticommuting ﬁelds of dimension hi andsimilarly for the dimension   hi ﬁelds φhi and ψhi for the termsinvolving a pair of scalars  commuting or anticommuting the passage to theform of the above equation involves a simple redeﬁnition which amounts to rewritethem is a ﬁrst order form for instance for eqn  we rewrite φ  φ  w  φwith w  φ since systems which are the same apart from their grasmanniannature have conformal anomaly which diﬀer by a sign it is obvious that the totalconformal anomaly vanishes c  pici  ci   one can reformulate  asan exact form under fermionic operators

φhi  ǫ ψhiδgφhi  ǫψhithe fact that the action is exact under a zero dimension fermionic symmetry hintsof the possibility to interpret the action as a brst gauge ﬁxed action this interpretation follows the original tqfts namely that the classical action is zeroand the  quantum action is derived by gauge ﬁxing of a topological symmetry one can take lclassicalψhi   which is invariant under the topologicalsymmetry δψhi  ǫhiz z or lclassical φhi   which is invariant underthe topological symmetry δ φhi  ǫhiz z replacing the parameters oftransformations with ghost ﬁelds φhi for the ﬁrst formulation and ψhi forthe second imposing holomorphicity of the original ﬁelds as the gauge conditionψhi   or  φhi   and using the brst transformations of eqn  onegets the action   notice that this prescription is diﬀerent from the brst gaugeﬁxing that was applied for the cases of pure gravity  tfc and tsm  it is thusapparent that various diﬀerent starting points for tcft lead to the same theorythis point will be further discussed in the last sectionso far we considered only the case of r   for the twisted n   actionit is equivalent to taking α   which is the semiclassical limit of this action sincek   a topological conformal ﬁeld theory tcft is characterized by the fact thatthe trace of the classical energy momentum vanishes all the tqft models presented in the previous section share this property in these cases tαβ as well asgαβ the brst current qα and the ghost number current jα can be split intotheir holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts hence one gets the following relations which reﬂect the brst multiplet structuret z  q gzqz  q jzby laurant expansion of these operators one ﬁnds using jacobi identities the tcftalgebra this algebra together with its generalization will be presented in the nextsectionnext we analyze the symmetries of the tcft let us ﬁrst discuss the symmetries generated by j t q and g to simplify the notation we choose todemonstrate all the features in the twisted n   model eqn  with α   orr   later we explain how to generalize it to the case of nonﬂat world sheetand to the other models included in the general form

the opeof the basic ﬁeldsφz φω  logz  ωλzλω we wish now to address the question of whether the transformations of eqn exhaust the symmetries of the tcft models in what follows we consideronly compact riemann surfaces so the invariance of the action will be checkedalways up to total derivatives the answer to this question is deﬁnitely no thearsenal of symmetries is much richer there are in fact three types of symmetrytransformations i bosonic or fermionic transformations which involve only thecommuting or the anticommuting parts of the action like δj for a  a   iibosonic symmetries acting on both sectors like δt and iii fermionic symmetriesmixing the two sectors like δq and δg before dwelling into the second and thirdtypes let us write the most general invariance of each of the sectors separatelylet us look for instance on the bosonic sector this part of the action is invariantunder the separate transformation of φ and φ as followsδφ  ǫ wf  w δ φ  ǫw f w where w  φ f w  is a general function of w  w f w  is its derivative withrespect to w and similarly for the ﬁelds with φ in particular any polynomialsof w and w for f and f will do the job symmetries which leave the fermionicsector invariant are for example those which are generated by λ or λ δλ  ǫδλ  ǫnext we want to check whether there are generalizations of the fermionic symmetries generated by q and g one ﬁnds that the following currents generate suchsymmetriesqn  dnλgn  dnλwhere the covariant derivatives are d   + w   + φ and d    w     φand dn is the nth power of d the fermionic generators q and g

structure also for the nth levelby deﬁnition w n and w n are created by applying q and g on gn and qnrespectively however qn and gn are not derivable from w n and w n byacting with q and g one has to modify w n and w n in the following way togenerate from them qn and gn first note thatthe next task is to show that all these fermionic and bosonic symmetries arein fact shared by all the models of the previous section to prove this we ﬁrsttreat the general case of eqn and then we consider the case of eqn forr   and α   the action  is clearly a sum of decoupled actions  as longas it is not coupled to tg so we can separate the symmetry generators for eachseparate part qnto eqns  and  we need dimension one ﬁelds as connections in the covariantderivatives for this purpose one can bosonize

    "text": "introductionthe transverse lattice approach to  +  yangmills theory qcd originally developed by bardeen and pearson over ten years ago incorporates conceptual andcomputational advantages that are found separately in other formulations like thed euclidean lattice formulation the physical degrees of freedom are link variablesof a discrete lattice which are interpreted as phase factors eir a the transverse lattice models incorporate the nonperturbative dynamics of qcd and are well suitedfor studying the bound state spectrum however in the transverse lattice construction the lattice is only twodimensional local d continuum gauge ﬁeldsare also present to gauge the symmetries at each site the local gauge invarianceis then used to eliminate via gauge ﬁxing the d gauge ﬁelds in favor of a nonlocal coulomb interaction for the link ﬁelds this is accomplished in a lightconegauge a   and with lightcone quantization so that a+ can be eliminated byusing its equation of constraint all physical states have positive lightcone energyp + this eliminates two degrees of freedom and simpliﬁes the classiﬁcation of thebound states see ref  for further discussion of the advantages of the lightconeapproachthe basic action for each link on the transverse lattice is the d unitary su n principal chiral nonlinear sigma model although this sigma model is exactlysolvable via a betheansatz technique this solution cannot be easily applied inthe transverse lattice context the bardeen pearson model is a linear sigma modelapproximation of the nonlinear model in which the unitarity constraint of the linkﬁelds is relaxed the n  n matrices of the linear sigma model are constrainedby introducing potential terms into the theory which are designed to drive thesystem into the nonlinear phase in the numerical work of bardeen pearsonand rabinovici glueballs are constructed from local twolink and fourlink boundstates which are smeared over the d lattice this truncation of the hilbert spaceis a nonperturbative lightfront tammdancoﬀ approximation to the qcd boundstate problem the numerical results based on this approach were inconclusivethe links were weakly coupled via the coulomb interation and the spectrum wasqualitatively similar to what would be obtained from a strong coupling expansionin ordinary lattice gauge theorythere are a number of changes one could make to their original analysis thatmight improve the situation this paper will focus on directly solving the nonlinearsigma model dynamics instead of using the linear sigma model approximation byintroducing wesszumino terms into the sigma model action we will describe thenonlinear sigma model dynamics in the basis of operators given by the wellstudiedand exactly solvable wesszuminowitten wzw model the wzw currentswill be the linear variables which describe exactly the dynamics of the nonlinearsigma model the wesszumino terms in the action will become irrelevant operatorsin the continuum limitthe nonlinear aspects of the principle chiral sigma model are retained in thewzw model the unitary link ﬁelds and products of link ﬁelds appear as theprimary ﬁelds of the wzw model and play a crucial role in deﬁning the highestweight states of the hilbert space of the wzw model the highest weight statescorrespond to zero modes of wilson loops on the transverse lattice this zero modestructure is lacking in the linear sigma model treatment of the transverse latticetheory the structure presumably corresponds to the space of soliton excitationsof the linear sigma model ﬁeldsthe advantage of exactly solvable nonlinear sigma model dynamics must beweighed against the two potential disadvantages of this approach first this wzwmodel approach will only work for the discrete values of bare sigma model couplingconstants which correspond to the nontrivial wzw ﬁxed points this will in turnplace a constraint on the qcd coupling constants that this model can obtain in thecontinuum limit these particular values are not special points in the context of +  qcd but rather these are points where we can apply our limited knowledgeof the d nonlinear sigma model to simplify the local dynamics of the link ﬁeldssecond the continuum limit may be diﬃcult to obtain because the irrelevant termsadded to simplify the local link dynamics may be large for ﬁnite lattice spacingsthis issue can only be resolved by explicit numerical simulationpreliminary work on the use of the gauged wzw model to describe the dynamics of lattice model links was discussed in ref  a transverse lattice modelwith one lattice dimension and two continuum dimensions was studied and it wasfound that assigning the same wesszumino term with the same coupling constantto each link leads to an order a term in the continuum limit where a is the latticespacing this order a term generates the  +  pure chernsimons action in thecontinuum limit and its dynamics was discussed in some detail the states of thechernsimons model correspond to zero modes of wilson loops similar states willgenerate the vacuum sectors in the  +  qcd model an important lesson fromthis work is that one cannot simply assign the same wesszumino term to eachlink in the  +  qcd case because the leading terms in the continuum limit mustgo as order a in this case and not order a as in the  +  chernsimons theorythis means that the wesszumino terms must be staggered from site to site withcoupling constants k the study of how to correctly stagger the wesszuminoterms is the major topic of this papersection  is review of the basic transverse lattice construction of qcd basedon the unitary nonlinear sigma model the degrees of freedom on the latticeare introduced and the naive continuum limit is taken by performing a blochwave expansion of the link ﬁeldsin section  we begin the analysis of addingwesszumino terms to the action it is found that the structure of the staggeredwesszumino terms which generate the coulomb potential that in turn correctlydrives the system to the desired continuum limit violates local gauge invariance bygenerating nonabelian anomaly terms in section  this diﬃculty is resolved bydeﬁning a new model which has a diﬀerent structure of local gauge invariance buthas the correct continuum limit in the new model pairs of nearest neighbor linksare associated with a single local d gauge symmetry and the anomalies from thewesszumino terms for each pair of sites cancel the local d gauge symmetry isreduced by a factor of two from the transverse lattice construction with no wesszumino terms the remaining local gauge symmetry for each pair of links in thebilocal transverse lattice model is then properly gauge ﬁxed in lightcone gauge insection  the current algebraic solution of the wzw model is reviewed

vacuum sectors of wilson loop zero modes and theintertwining operator which takes states from one sector to another is the plaquetteoperator discussed belowthe contribution of the coulomb interactions

each site x is similar to that obtainedin  +  qcd with massless fermions quantized following the same approach inthat case it is known that there is no mass gap generated by the coulomb interactions because states can be constructed from the u  fermion number currentwhich commutes with the nonabelian currents that make up the coulomb potential this is not the case for the new transverse lattice model since this currentdoes not exist in this case analysis of the thooft equation for linkantilinkbound states can make this result quantitative by determining the bare mass gapfor these states preliminary calculations show that a linear regge trajectory forthe mass spectrum is obtained in the large n limitthe plaquette interaction in  explicitly mixes leftmover and rightmoverin principle then one could eliminate leftmovers inmodes like a mass termterms of rightmovers by solving a constraint equation for each equal lightconetime surface x+  const however in practice this is very

discussionlike any other theory which describes nonperturbative behavior of qcd thetransverse lattice construction outlined above is very complicated the basic advantage over d lattice simulations is that a continuum analysis is used to describelocal link dynamics to take advantage of the continuum description one has toﬁnd a suitable truncation of the full model that still contains the desired physicsfor the calculation of glueball masses in in the bardeen pearson model the basic degrees of freedom were truncated to linkantilink and fourlink bound statesthese states mix under the plaquette interaction which also provides for transversemotion it is essential to complete this basic analysis for the new transverse latticemodel and verify that in this case the link number expansion is a valid one ie thatlink number violation is strong enough to allow for transverse motion of the statesyet small enough to validate the link number expansionthe physical state of the linkantilink and fourlink truncated basis is a wilsonloop smeared over the lattice the linkantilink states correspond to wilson loopswhich extend in the longitudinal directions this type of state in the gauge ﬁxedtransverse lattice model is the bilinear u xuy integrated over a wavefunctionthe linkantilink bound state is not a bilinear j aj a of wzw currents althoughthe currents are the linear degrees of freedom of the wzw model the real degreesof freedom of the lattice theory are the link ﬁeldsthe spectrum of bound states that can be constructed by the above formalismis degenerate because the zero mode of the state can be shifted and boosted bylorentz transformations we want to select a basis of bound states that does notcontain copies of the same state moreover we want a basis of states for which oneof the momentum operators is manifestly diagonal for instance in the linear sigmamodel analysis p  was manifestly diagonal this type of analysis in the bilocalmodel is complicated because as discussed above both the left and rightmovercurrents are treated as dynamical there is no simple constraint equation whichcan be used to solve for one set in terms of the otherthere is a basis of states one can use to study in the simplest way the boundstate spectrum it is deﬁned by allowing zeromode excitations for both left andrightmovers but truncating all nonzero mode excitations of the leftmovers theparity conjugate basis is equally simple there is no proof that all physical stateshave a representative is this truncated basis however this truncation is similar tothe analysis of ref  where the spectrum of the massless schwinger model wasstudied there bound states were constructed from fermions of only one chiralityin this chiral schwinger model there exists only one copy of the free massive scalarboson instead of the inﬁnite number of degenerate copies which exist in the fullschwinger model nevertheless the single copy has the correct mass againthe idea here is to suggest a starting point for the explicit calculation of the massspectrumin the truncated basis a local linkantilink state is given bypi i dzi dypxkwk zkykp tr  φzφy  i unlike d lattice gauge theory the transverse lattice construction may be ableto generate structure functions of relativistic bound states since the wavefunctionsof the states are explicitly calculated when diagonalizing the mass

between ﬂat coordinates and thediﬀerential equations of section  and derive in detail the ﬂat coordinate of a familyof k surfaces we will also discuss the role of the duality group of the

anapplication of the work of k saito a recent rather brief exposition of this appearedin  our intention here is not only to simplify the exposition still further butalso to show that if one restricts to relevant and marginal perturbations then thecalculations can be simpliﬁed indeed contrary to the expectations expressed in it becomes relatively straightforward to solve topological models whose underlyingconformal theory has c   chiral rings and diﬀerential equations for periodsin this section we will for simplicity consider a d dimensional nonsingularhypersurface v  deﬁned by the vanishing

greater than the number of such invariant pβswe conclude this section by calculating a couple of examples first we considerthe cubic torus that is we take d   µ  α andw xa    and hence  where the

that leads to the ﬂat coordinates is the choice of an integralcohomology basis this in a very strong sense means that we are choosing a locallyconstant frame for the cohomology ﬁbration over the space of moduliin the following we will not restrict ourselves to  folds but we will considerprojective coordinates ζa that are provided by the expansion of the the holomorphicd form on a general calabiyau manifoldin section  we saw how to derive a linear system of equations  that issatisﬁed by the periods za obviously if one multiplies ω by f za then one willobtain a diﬀerent set of equations and thus  is not unique the appropriateinvariant equation is a non linear system of equations for ζa that can be derivedfrom the linear system for zafor example the linear second order equationdz  gives rise to the nonlinear schwarzian diﬀerential equationcidζ µcid   i i  q    it follows that the linear system of diﬀerential equations must be covariant withrespect to the duality group of the superpotential that is if zµi is a solutionthen so is µihµizˆµiµi the corresponding system of nonlinear equationsmust be invariant with respect to this duality group this duality covariance andinvariance can be very instructive in understanding the properties of the linear andnonlinear equations turning this around it allows in principle to determine γwfrom the diﬀerential equations in particular given a second order equation one can often read oﬀ the solution of the associated schwarzian equation in terms oftriangle functions sα β γ the parameters α β and γ then determine the dualitygroup of the superpotential for triangle functions this group can be thought ofas being generated by reﬂections in the sides of hyperbolic triangles with anglesπα πβ and πγ that cover the upper halfplaneit is thus of interest to understand the relationship between the foregoing duality group γw  the monodromy group γm of the linear equations and the modulargroup γ of the surface the integral homology basis undergoes an integral symplectic transformation when it is transported around singular points in the modulispace of the manifold consequently the periods of the diﬀerential forms undergojust such symplectic transformations about these singular points this is directlyreﬂected in the monodromy around regular singular points of the solutions of thediﬀerential equations the set of all such monodromies will generate a subgroupγm  of the modular group γ the set of duality transformations γw of the superpotential maps the surface back to itself and will thus extend the group γm toan even larger subgroup of γ in some cases this extension is all of γ and then theduality group of w is γw  γγm we are uncertain as to the general validity of this conclusion but a simpleillustration is provided by the cubic torus  the nonlinear system associatedto  is given by the schwarziancid α tcid    which is solved by the triangle function αt  s   let y y and y be solutions of  and deﬁne s and

ksurfaces could have involved a non trivial w invariant but instead we found thatw vanishedin this sense the structure is determined merely by the virasoroalgebra that is by the schwarzian diﬀerential equation it would be very interesting to discover to what extent the higher dimensionalsurfaces deﬁned by  might be similarly reduced and to understand whetherthe appearance of such reduced w algebras has any deeper meaning in particularnote that the solutions of  are algebraically related inspection of  showsthat    and as we have seen this is a consequence of the vanishing ofwit turns out that for the quintic ie for  one also has w   butw   and it is known that the gb in  are homogenous functions of the zathus it appears that the vanishing of w generators is closely connected to algebraicrelations between the solutions we hope to discuss these issues elsewhere flat coordinates for generic perturbationswe now wish to generalize the methods of section  to marginal and releventperturbations of arbitrary topological landauginzburg ﬁeld theories the basicproblem is that general n   superconformal theories have no obvious analogue ofintegral cohomology as discussed in the previous section it is this that leads oneto ﬂat coordinates for calabiyau spacesfor general topological matter models one can make a general ansatz for f  orfor w  in terms of the ﬂat coordinates and then evolve algebraic and diﬀerentialequations from consistency conditions of the topological matter models   in particular one requires that the cijk be given by  and that they satisfy however solving the system  is extremely laborious except in the simplestcases  thus we like to obtain diﬀerential equations that determine the ﬂat coordinatesmore directly from the superpotential let wxa be a quasihomogenous superpotential and w xa si be a parametrization of a general versal deformation of w byelements φα of the chiral ring the problem is to determine the relationship betweenthe general coordinates si and the ﬂat coordinates ti once the parametrization ofw in terms of the ti is known the free energy f and all correlation functions caneasily be computedwe will regard w xa si as a quasihomogenous function of xa and si and thusthe coupling constants si can be assigned dimensions we will adopt the conventionthat both w and w have dimension equal to one below we will actually consideronly marginal and relevant perturbations whose corresponding coupling constantswill have vanishing or positive dimensions this will lead to the major simpliﬁcationthat all quantities will have polynomial dependence on the coupling constants withpositive dimension and the only nonpolynomial behavior will be via the marginalparametersthe coupling constant associated to the constant term in w

    "text": "introductionrecent studies of twodimensional euclidean gravity have yielded a host of surprisesthese surprises have come from lattice deﬁnitions  continuum pathintegral deﬁnitions and topological ﬁeld theory deﬁnitions of what is presumably thesame theoryamong the surprises from the latticematrixmodel approach has been the discoveryof theories which look very similar to the solved models of twodimensional gravity coupledto matter but for which no continuum or topological interpretation has been found forexample a particularly natural family of matrix models can be derived from the integralover a unitary matrix these have a double scaling limit whose exact solution is strikinglysimilar to that of the lattice gravity models with the kdv hierarchy being replaced by themkdv hierarchy  one is naturally led to ask whether these theories have equallysimple worldsheet interpretationsthe simplest way to attack this problem would be to ﬁnd an interpretation of theperturbation expansion for the theory as a lattice gravity theory possibly with matter andappropriate weights in the sum over graphs and directly take the worldsheet continuumlimit this can be diﬃcult since the same continuum theory can be obtained from manydiﬀerent matrix models the important point is not the type of matrix but rather thestructure of the saddlepoint eigenvalue distribution near its points of nonanalyticitythe mkdv scaling limits come from tuning a coupling to a critical point where two endpoints of the eigenvalue distribution collide this is generic for a unitary matrix butis easy to arrange for a hermitian matrix as well for example by taking a doublewellpotential  thus there are many possible graphical formalisms which one mighttry to interpret perturbation theory for the unitary matrix integral can be done bychanging variables u  exp ih the resulting graphs have vertices of arbitrary order aswell as fermionic lines coming from a fermionic representation of the jacobian  wewill discuss this expansion further in the conclusions alternatively one could sum overthe expansions about the various minima of the doublewell problemit is not obvious how to interpret any of these lattice theories because we do notknow how to take the continuum limit directly on the worldsheet the simplest latticegravity  is exceptional since it has the correct degrees of freedom and an everywherepositive measure nevertheless already with nonpositive measures there are subtleties inthe continuum limit which can reproduce gravity coupled to matter  the measuresin the present problem are too complicated for heuristic arguments all this underscoresthe importance of developing a more precise understanding of this continuum limitsince we cannot deduce the continuum theory directly from the lattice we are forced tocompare the structure of the exact solution of the lattice theory with the structure of knowncontinuum theories with this motivation we describe below the exact solution of thelattice theory in some detail in section two we derive from the lattice the complete stringand ﬂow equations for twocut models including all even and odd perturbations in

are summarized in thestring equation  recursions  observables  and ﬂows to derive the full continuum loop equations for unitary matrix models we will workwith the twocut hermitian matrix model and

that by modifying the action to includeboundaries or quark degrees of freedom one can introduce a nonzero constant on theleft hand side of the string equation generalizes  moreover it may be equivalently written as aﬂatness condition generalizing that in dcidlto the string equations chosen by the matrix model will in general lead to nontrivial stokesdata as described in  this implies that the τ function does not correspond to a pointin the segalwilson grassmannian although it does correspond to a point in the satograssmannian loop equationsthe solutions of onematrix models satisfy schwingerdyson equations which can bederived by variation of the functional integral  these have a double scaling limit which in the kdvtype systems can be rewritten as virasoro constraints on thepartition function since the same schwingerdyson equations apply before taking the continuum limitto the twocut hermitian matrix model and since the unitary matrix model has analogousschwingerdyson equations one would expect continuum loop equations to exist in thiscase as wellpreviously we had derived a subset of these loop equations with two nonzero couplings by directly scaling the matrix model schwingerdyson equations  here wederive the complete loop equations from the string equationmkdv formalism the argument is similar to that used in  for the kdv theories using the ﬂow equations thestring equation can be reformulated as a diﬀerential constraint on the partition functionas a function of the couplings in principle we can then derive a series of constraints asfollows the same recursion relation which takes the nth ﬂow to the n +st can be appliedto the nth constraint to ﬁnd a new constraintsince the constraint operators all annihilate the partition function they form a leftideal therefore commutators of constraints are also constraints guided by our expectation that the constraints form a virasoro algebra we will ﬁnd a minimal set of constraintswhich generate this algebra the completeness of the resulting algebra will then follow ifwe can argue that there is a unique solution of the resulting constraints this will be truein a certain sense to be discussed belowthe scaling operator corresponding to the coupling tn will be called σn σ will alsobe called p  though one should probably think of the p as standing for primary and notpuncture for reasons explained below the string equation is now sf  sg   and ourconstraints will be derived from combinations of thesewe start with  gsg  f sfxk dxkktkhσkp piktkhσkiwhich we interpret as the second derivative of an l constraint the explicit dependenceon t has cancelled outthe recursion relations imply that ggk+f fk+  gf kf gk so we can get anotherequation fromktkhσkp pi + g  f ktkhσkp pi + hp pi

will skip l which is similarand proceed to the l constraint since it will generate the complete algebra using therecursions three times we havektkhσk+p pii xkwith xk  gf hkf ghk the x piece is identically zero by the l constraint and its derivativesdnxkktkhσki xkktkdnhkusing sf p ktkf k + g   resp for g this isi  the integration constants in the constraints must be compatible with the virasoroalgebra otherwise the commutator of two constraints would generate new constraintswhich would force z to be trivial an obvious possibility would be to include the zeromode of the boson as wellφz xkkzktk + zq +xkzk with solutiong + f  cexg  f  cexc and c are constants of integration although these solutions are trancendental physical quantities are not for examplehσσi connected with the diﬃculty of deﬁning this pure topological phase in the matrix model our odd perturbations of the potential  really only make sense as perturbations ofeven potentials on the other hand the structure of the pure topological phase seems veryclear from the solution so we will not let this stop us from studying itthe ghost number conservation law follows most directly from the loop equationsif we write them in terms of our boson φz they are homogeneous in z so the ghostnumber assignment of each operator and coupling must be just the associated power of zin a mode expansion up to a possible constant shift we can use this constant shift tomake the ghost number of one coupling of our choice zero if we choose t setting t  will not break ghost number conservationfor topological gravity this is the end of the story the special role of t in this theoryis that it is the only choice of nonzero coupling for which all operator insertions have anassociated recursion relation in the present case both t and q must be set nonzero andthey have diﬀerent ghost number q having that of t a simple example of a correlationfunction which shows that q must be assigned ghost number ishσσi  λqx  λqx + λqx  λqxwhere λ counts derivatives powers of n we can maintain a ghost number conservation law if we take q nonzero but treat itas the coupling of a new operator in the theory if the operator σn is given ghost number n then q will couple to an operator q with ghost number  now the basic correlationfunction on the sphere ishσσqi   macroscopic loops for unitarymatrix modelsit has recently been shown that the study of macroscopic loop amplitudes  isparticularly wellsuited for the comparison of continuumliouville and matrix model formulations of d quantum gravity   in particular the wheelerdewitt equationplays a central role in making such comparisons in this appendix we derive analogousmacroscopic loop amplitudes for the unitarymatrix model and show that they too obeya wheelerdewittlike equation this equation gives a hint about the proper worldsheetinterpretation of these theoriesthe macroscopic loop operator is deﬁned to be ψeℓlψ in the fermionic formulationwhere ψ is a twocomponent fermi ﬁeld obtained from scaling the even and odd indexedorthogonal polynomials and l is the lax operator representing multiplication by λ theonepoint function is thereforehwℓi z tℓcid df  gdxhxtref

zero wavefunction at tree level the integral in only converges in a distributional sense we may imagine regularizing the originalmacroscopic loop operator so as to obtain an additional factor of eǫwe assume that the multicritical phases of the matrix model deﬁned by k        arecharacterized by the identiﬁcation of the wavefunction of the cosmological constant withψν for ν  k   plugging into  we ﬁnd a series of matter theories with centralchargesνc   the ﬁrst candidate is d supergravity the multicritical points would correspondto supergravity coupled to the  k superminimal matter theories as already discussedin  evidence for this is  the structure of even and odd scaling operators and theirdimensions match the  k series of superminimal matter  correlators of even neveuschwarz operators agree with those of bosonic gravity at tree level   there is nospacetime supersymmetry or grassmann couplings as one might expect for supergravitycoupled to low c minimal models with no possibility of gso projectionclearly the above is not very compelling evidence one would like to have for example tree level ramond correlators or an understanding of the superwdw equation tomake a more deﬁnite statement higher genus correlators could also settle the questionbut problems associated with sums over spin structures make these diﬃcult to calculatein particular the calculation of the oneloop partition function from the continuum theory could be revealing the contribution for the even spin structures has been carefullydetermined in  there is a further point which is rather diﬃcult to reconcile with thisinterpretation the twocut model in one dimension is the same to all orders in perturbation theory as the onecut model   this would be rather surprising for ˆc  matter coupled to supergravity nevertheless the supergravity interpretation has not yetbeen deﬁnitely ruled outthe second candidate is dense polymers or the on   fermionic model thesetwo being intimately related nonunitary matter theories with c    coupled tolorentzian metric gravity the principle evidence for this was described in section ﬁveand follows from assuming that the macroscopic loop amplitudes satisfy the wheelerdewitt equation of d gravity a further hint that this is the correct interpretation comesfrom examining in detail the perturbation series of the simplest unitarymatrix modelusing the action in  the feynman perturbation series can be written as a sum oversurfaces together with a sum over selfavoiding loop conﬁgurations the fermion loops onthose surfaces unfortunately the boltzman weights for the loops are similar to but notprecisely equal to those of the on model and it is not clear if the diﬀerence is important atcriticality moreover in this interpretation it is also rather mysterious that the partitionfunctions at every genus should be positive  finally the zzodd loops should becalculated and compared with the n s sector of the polymer problemthe third candidate is a candidate for the topological phase discussed in section fourthe similarity of the structure of the topological phase to the kdvtype systems stronglysuggests that the theory has a topological interpretation ghost number counting rules outthe obvious possibility that it is osp topological gravity another idea follows fromrecalling the identiﬁcation of t with the yangmills θ angle described below  inthe continuum this operator becomes simply r trf which could serve as an action for atopological yangmills matter theory which could then be coupled to topological gravity  however there are some troubles with any candidate topological mattertheory if we have a theory of topological gravity coupled to topological matter then asshown by dijkgraaf and witten there must be a puncture operator p which satisﬁes apuncture equation expressing an insertion of p in terms of correlation functions of lowerdegree the natural candidate for the puncture equation would be the l constrainthowever this interpretation would make all operators σn descendants of a single primaryσ which seems incompatible with the uniqueness of the known tft with a single primaryin addition ghost number conservation required us to introduce a new operator q withno descendants which does not ﬁt at all into the topological gravity frameworkalthough it is possible that a diﬀerent interpretation of the model exists which ismore compatible with the original topological gravity framework we did not ﬁnd such adescription and suspect that it does not existif this is true clearly it would be

theseconditions the boltzmann weights  become the scattering smatrix for two of theseconﬁgurations with rapidities ξ and ξ see ﬁg figure  smatrix interpretation of the uqsℓ rmatrix notice that the conditions we have used in the previous section for solving the yangbaxter equation are very natural in this solitonic interpretationin fact the reﬂectionrelations  simply mean that the scattering is invariant under parity transformationsthe condition r   can now be interpreted as some kind of vacuum stability noticethat this condition is very dependent on the highest weight vector nature of semicyclicrepresentations moreover the normalization condition  and the unitarity property strongly support the smatrix interpretation the main diﬀerence between the model and chiral potts is that for  we allow for all sites in the same plaquette arbitraryzn variablesinteractions win this way we loose the chiral diﬀerence between vertical and horizontalcoming back to the smatrix picture the decomposition rules  should be interpreted asreﬂecting some kind of bootstrap property this naive interpretation is not quite correctin fact the decomposition rule  implies a strictly quantum composition of the rapiditiesdetermined by the hopf algebra structure of the center zǫ of uǫsℓ at ǫ a root of unitthis is a new phenomenon derived from the fact that we are considering something thatlooks like a factorized smatrix for particles but where the kinematical properties of theseparticles the rapidities are quantum group eigenvalues and therefore their compositionrules are not classical moreover from the explicit expression of the clebschgordan we observe another interesting phenomenon of mixing between what we should considerinternal quantum numbers those labelling the basis for the representation ie  the rswith the kinematical ones ie the ones labelling the irreps see ﬁg if this physicalpicture is correct this is the ﬁrst case where the quantum group appears not only at the levelof internal symmetries but also determines the kinematicsfigure  decomposition rules derived from the clebschgordan coefﬁcients  with the quantum group decomposition of rapiditiesfrom a strictly quantum group point of view we can using the intertwiner solution and the cg coeﬃcients  check some of the standard results in representation theory ofquantum groups as an interesting example we consider the relationrξ ξkξξξ  φξ ξ ξkξξξwhich is true for regular representations of spin j with φj j j  j+jjǫcj cj cjand cj  jj +  the classical casimir for semicyclic representations and the case n  we have found that the factors φξ ξ ξ in  are equal to one and we presume that thisfact persists for all n the limit n  in this section we shall study the limit n   of the rmatrix found in section  thequantum deformation parameter ǫ goes in this limit to  so one could expect that the hopfalgebra uǫsℓ becomes the classical universal enveloping algebra of sℓ this is nothowever what is happening here as can be seen by taking ǫ   in eqs e f     kk e  k f   let us recall that in the quantum group relations  we have not included the denominator  ǫ hence there is no need to apply the lhˆopital rule what we obtain rather in thelimit n   is the heisenberg algebra of a harmonic oscillator inded deﬁning a and a asa which corresponds to a sphere with  punctures at the points z  λ z  λ z  and z   in these new variables we haverr+rℓℓrrη interpreting λi as the velocity of the ith soliton then uij is nothing but the relative speedof the ith soliton with respect to the jth soliton in a  +  relativistic world moreoverthe yb equation  when written in the u variables has a relativistic look  rucidrcid u + vwhere r  eiπn    eaa etcwe have thus seen that the limit n   of our construction is well deﬁned and hassome interesting structure it describes essentially the scattering of relativistic solitons whosespectrum is that of a harmonic oscillator interestingly enough in the limit of very deepscattering one obtains an inﬁnitedimensional representation of the braid group one maywonder whether this representation provides us with new invariants of knots and links justas the usual ﬁnitedimensional r matrices from quantum groups dowith this in mind we shall propose a slight generalization of the r matrices  givenbyrx y +  xn  yn eyxaarx y   exyaayn  xn where x and y are two

in more detail the physical meaning of our resultscould be the one recently developed by zamolodchikov  in connection with the analysis ofintegrable deformations of conformal ﬁeld theories the moral we obtain from our analysisis that a unique mathematical structure the quantum group can describe at the same timeconformal ﬁeld theories  and integrable models the dynamics that ﬁxes what of the twokinds of physical systems is described is the way the central subalgebra zǫ for q a root of unitis realized in the conformal case the central subalgebra is realized trivially with vanishingeigenvalues which correspond to the regular representations the quantum group symmetryis deﬁned in this case by the hopf algebra quotiented by its central subalgebra from theresults in   and the ones described here it seems that when the center is realized in anontrivial way the system we describe is an integrable model the startriangle solution for the lattice model we have deﬁned in section  has good chances of describing aselfdual point the heuristic reason for this is that the algebraic curve  on which thespectral parameters live is of genus zerowe want to mention also the possible physical implications in this context of the recentmathematical results of reference in fact these authors have deﬁned a quantum coadjoint action on the space of irreps this action divides the ﬁnitedimensional irreps intoorbits each one containing a semicyclic representation the coadjoint action does notpreserve the spectral manifold  but if we maintain the interpretation of the irrep labelsas rapidities then it acts on them opening in this way the door to new kinematics completelybased on quantum group propertiesfinally we summarize the nontrivial results we have obtained in the limit n  first of all the intertwiner matrix for semicyclic representations can be interpreted asdescribing the scattering of solitons in a  +  relativistic world the hilbert space of thesesolitons is

    "text": "introductionthese notes are an expanded version of the lectures i gave at the  ictpspring school on string theory and quantum gravity here i have attempted toreview from my own personal viewpoint some of the exciting developments in twodimensional string theory that have taken place over the last year and a half becauseof the multitude of new results and since the ﬁeld is still developing rapidly a comprehensive review must await a later date these notes are mainly devoted to thematrix model approach that has truly revolutionized the twodimensional euclideanquantum gravity recently this approach has led to the exact solution of quantumgravity coupled to conformal matter systems with c  these lectures are about the c   model that is both the richest physicallyand among the most easily soluble this model is deﬁned by the sum over geometriesembedded in  dimension the resulting string theory is however dimensionalbecause the dynamical conformal factor of the world sheet geometry acts as an extrahidden string coordinatein fact this is the maximal bosonic string theory thatis welldeﬁned perturbatively if the dimensionality is increased any further then atachyon appears in the string spectrum and renders the theory unstable the matrixmodel maps the theory of surfaces embedded in  dimension into a nonrelativisticquantum mechanics of free fermionsfrom which virtually any quantity can becalculated to all orders in the genus expansion the secondquantized ﬁeld theoryof nonrelativistic fermions can be regarded here as the exact string ﬁeld theory atransformation of this theory to a rather simple interacting boson representationwill also be giveni will argue that the dimensional string theory is the kindof toy model which possesses a remarkably simple structure and at the same timeincorporates some of the physics of string theories embedded in higher dimensionsthe simplicity of the theory is apparent in the matrix model approach but much ofit remains obscure and mysterious from the point of view of the continuum polyakovpath integral until we develop a better insight into the miracles of the matrixmodels we may be sure that our understanding of string physics is very incompletethese notes are mainly a review of published papers but i also included a fewnew observations and results in section  i review the formulation of quantum gravity coupled to a scalar ﬁeld as a sum over discretized random surfaces embedded in dimension i will show that the matrix quantum mechanics generates the necessarystatistical sum in section  i exhibit the reduction to free fermions and deﬁne thedoublescaling limit the sum over continuous surfaces is calculated to all orders inthe genus expansion in section  i show how to calculate the exact string amplitudesusing the free fermion formalism section  is devoted to the continuum path integralformalism where the liouville ﬁeld acts as an extra dimension of string theorysome of the exact matrix model results will be reproduced but this approach stillfalls far short of the power of the matrix model in section  i discuss the specialstates which exist in the spectrum in addition to the massless tachyon thesestates occurring only at integer momenta are leftovers of the transverse excitationsof string theory remarkably they generate a chiral w+ algebra in section  iuse the matrix model to formulate the exact string ﬁeld theory both in the fermionicand in bosonic terms i present some manifestly ﬁnite bosonic calculations which arein perfect agreement with the fermionic ones in section  i discuss the new physicaleﬀects that arise when the random surfaces are embedded in a circle of radius r ther  r duality and its breaking due to kosterlitzthouless vortices this modelcan be regarded either as a compactiﬁed euclidean string theory or as a minkowskisignature string theory at ﬁnite temperature in section  i show that in the matrixquantum the eﬀects of vortices are implemented by the states in the nontrivial representations of sun including only the sun singlet sector gives the vortexfreecontinuum limit where the sum over surfaces respects r  r duality in section i use the thermal ﬁeld theory of nonrelativistic fermions to ﬁnd exact amplitudesof the compactiﬁed string theory finally in section  i use the matrix chain modelto solve a string theory with a discretized embedding dimension remarkably whenthe lattice spacing is not too large this theory is exactly equivalent to string theorywith a continuous embedding discretized random surfacesand matrix quantum mechanicsin this section i will introduce the discretized approach to summation over randomsurfaces embedded in one dimension and its matrix model implementationif weparametrize continuous surfaces by coordinates σ σ then the euclidean geometryis described by the metric gµνσ and the embedding  by the scalar ﬁeld xσthus the theory of random surfaces in one embedding dimension is equivalent to dquantum gravity coupled to a scalar ﬁeld in the euclidean path integral approach tosuch a theory we have to sum over all the compact connected geometries and theirembeddingsz  xtopologiesz dgµνdxes the integration measure is deﬁned modulo reparametrizations ie diﬀerent functions describing the same geometryembedding in diﬀerent coordinates should not becounted separately we assume the simplest generally covariant massless actions iijjfig  a small section of triangulated surface solid lines denote the triangular lattice λ and dotted lines  the dual lattice λthe vertex i has a δfunction of curvature with positive zero or negative strengthif qi       respectively such a distribution of curvature may seem like apoor mans version of geometry however in the continuum limit the size of eachface becomes inﬁnitesimal and we may deﬁne smoothed out curvature by averagingover many triangles in this way the continuum ﬁeld for the metric should appearsimilarly to how the quantum ﬁeld description emerges in the continuum limit of themore familiar statistical systems such as the ising model the xy model etc lateron we will show some strong indications that the discretized approach to summingover geometries is indeed equivalent to the continuum ﬁeldtheoretic approachthe essential assumption of the discretized approach is that sum over genus hgeometries r dgµνh may be deﬁned as the sum over all distinct lattices λ with thelattice spacing subsequently taken to zero r dx is then deﬁned as the integral overall possible embeddings of the lattice λ in the real line for simplicity the latticesλ may be taken to be triangular but admixture of higher polygons should not aﬀectthe continuum limit in order to complete the deﬁnition of the discretized approachwe need to specify the weight attached to each conﬁguration this can be deﬁned bysimply discretizing the action of eq  and counting each distinct conﬁgurationwith weight es we will ﬁnd it convenient to specify the embedding coordinatesx at the centers of the triangles ie at the vertices i of the dual lattice then thediscretized version ofintegralz z dn t φx expcidβzt dx tr  further comparing eqs and  we note that the size of the matrixn enters as g let us show why each vertex contributes a factor  n eachedge propagator  n and each face contributes n because there are as manyindex loops as there are faces thus each graph is weighted by n v e+f whichby eulers theorem equals n h the expansion of the free energy of the matrixquantum mechanics in powers of n  automatically classiﬁes surfaces according totopology it would seem that in order to deﬁne a theory with a ﬁnite string couplingit is necessary to consider ﬁnite n which as we will see is associated with severediﬃculties fortunately this naive expectation is falsein the continuum limit thebare string coupling n becomes inﬁnitely multiplicatively renormalized thus ifn is taken to  simultaneously with the world sheet continuum limit then we mayobtain a theory with a ﬁnite string coupling this remarkable phenomenon known asthe doublescaling limit will allow us to calculate sums over continuum surfacesof any topologyin order to reach the continuum limit it is necessary to increase the cubic couplingκ  p matrix quantum mechanics and free fermionsin the previous section we established the equivalence of the sum over connecteddiscretized surfaces to the logarithm of the path integral of the matrix quantummechanics on the other hand in the hamiltonian languagez  feβhti  thus as long as the initial and ﬁnal states have some overlap with the ground statethe ground state energy e will dominate the t   limit of eq ln zlimtmatrix ωω can be decomposed in terms of the generators of sunωω ithe constraints require that only those irreducible representations of sunthat have a state with all weights equal to zero are allowed in the matrix quantum mechanics for instance the fundamental representations are excluded andthe simplest nontrivial representation is the adjoint it is not hard to classify all theirreducible representations allowed in the matrix quantum mechanics ie the

and all we need to know is the complete expansion of the single particle density ofstates ρµ if we consider µ such that βµ is o then this problem has a remarkablysimple solution because eq  shows that

correctly give the nonperturbative terms oeβµ in fact suchterms depend on the details of the potential away from the quadratic maximum andare not universal while each term in the large βµ expansion is related to the sumover all geometries of a certain genus we do not yet fully understand the geometricalor physical meaning of the nonperturbative termsafter expanding eq  and integrating once we ﬁnd the complete series ofcorrections to the leading order estimate in eq ρµ string theories while in ﬁeld theory we typically ﬁnd that the sum over hloopdiagrams exhibits a slower growth  h the badly divergent perturbation series indicates that the theory is not welldeﬁned nonperturbativelyeq  shows explicitly how the bare string coupling β gets multiplicativelyrenormalized compared to the c

another peculiarity of the c   matter is that the sums over spherical and toroidalsurfaces diverge in the continuum limit as  ln µ in section  we will argue that allthese features have a natural explanation in the context of liouville theory beforewe do that however we further exhibit the power of the matrix model by calculatingsome correlation functions to all orders in the topological expansion correlation functionsthe simplest kind of matrix model operator is tr φnx where n is any ﬁniteinteger this operator inserts a vertex of order n in all possible places on the dualgraph λ in terms of the basic lattice λ this amounts to cutting an ngon hole inthe surface pinning it at the embedding coordinate x and integrating the positionof the hole all over the surface in the continuum limit for any ﬁnite n the size ofthe hole becomes inﬁnitesimal and it is commonly referred to as a puncture thecontinuum expression for the operator above should be roughlyz dσmodel in section  we show that the results can indeed be reproduced in the stringtheoretic formalismsince the matrix model has been reduced to a system of free fermions it is convenient to perform calculations in the

inducedthrough quantum eﬀects arising from dependence on φ of the path integral measureadditional modiﬁcation of the dynamics of φ has been proposed by david and bydistler and kawai who argued that we can simplify the integration measure at theexpense of further renormalization of the action for φ such that the ghost x and φﬁelds combine into a conformally invariant theory with net conformal

formalism to calculate the spherical correlation functionsas discovered in ref  in performing the path integral it is convenient todecompose φ  φ + φ and integrate ﬁrst over the zero mode φ then since theinteraction is purely exponential we obtain nyit qi+h ghδx qi for the coeﬃcient of direct liouville theory calculations of correlation functions have not yet been performed even for genus  for h

region not over the strip performing the integrals in eq we ﬁnd f rthe correlation functions is provided by the fusion rules there are terms  zwin the fusion rules of the physical operators  integration over one operator nearanother can thus produce logarithmic divergenceslet us elaborate on this mechanism using as an example the tachyon pointfunction the poles in it occur when q is

the torus we found a massless twodimensional boson propagating around theloop from the decoupling at zero momentum observed in the study of the tachyoncorrelation functions we deduce that the theory is invariant under constant shifts ofthe tachyon ﬁeldthe second expected feature of twodimensionality is the absence of transverseoscillation modes of the string indeed if we could pass to the lightcone gauge thenall transverse oscillations would be eliminated and the entire spectrum of the stringtheory would consist of one massless ﬁeld in reality we cannot pick the lightconegauge because of the lack of translation invariance in the φcoordinate as a resultthe spectrum of the string contains the transverse excitations constructed in section these states are not fullﬂedged ﬁelds however because they only occur at discretemomenta q  n indeed the string oneloop calculation of section  showed thatthere are no massive transverse ﬁelds in the theory thus at the minimal level weshould be able to formulate the string ﬁeld theory with a single massless ﬁeld perhapscoupled to an inﬁnite number of quantum mechanical degrees of freedomin this section we show that a string ﬁeld theory with the features anticipatedabove can be derived directly from the matrix quantum mechanics this furtherstrengthens the connection of c   quantum gravity with string theory in d  the matrix quantum mechanics directly reduces to the exact string ﬁeld theory whichis the secondquantized ﬁeld theory of nonrelativistic fermions discussed in section in this section we will simply recast this formalism so that some of its physical featuresbecome more transparent first we will show that the nonrelativistic ﬁeld theorycan be expressed in the doublescaling limit as a theory of free quasirelativistic chiralfermions these chiral fermions have the kinetic term that is relativistic to ordergst but receives translationally noninvariant corrections of order gst further we willcarry out the conventional bosonization of this fermionic hamiltonian and obtainan interacting theory of massless bosons in d   ﬁrst derived by das and jevickiwith somewhat diﬀerent methods in conclusion we will perform a few manifestlyﬁnite calculations in the bosonic formalism to show that it is fully equivalent to theoriginal representation in terms of nonrelativistic fermions chiral fermionsin order to exhibit our general method we ﬁrst consider fermions moving in anarbitrary potential uλ when we later take the doublescaling limit as expected itwill depend only on the existence of a quadratic local maximum of

of the box in which the quasirelativistic fermions areenclosed diverges   ln µlet us introduce new fermionic variables ψl and ψrψλ t eiµf tof motion at the fermi level  rather than λ an important feature of the hamiltonianis that it does not mix ψl and ψrh  hl + hr the only mixing between the diﬀerent chiralities is through the boundary conditionsin order to determine the boundary conditions consider the leading semiclassicalexpression for ψλ ψλ  xnψnan + xmψmbm ψn ψr and ψl are not independent ﬁelds and that we are including the correct number ofdegrees of freedom the issue of dynamics at the boundary is quite subtle howeversince the corrections to the relativistic hamiltonian in eq  blow up preciselyat the boundary the problem is that the semiclassical approximation breaks downat the points where vτ    even as β   one possibility of dealing with thisbreakdown is to carefully regularize the physics at the boundary points this haslead to some success we will suggest another method which is problemfreefrom the beginning to approach doublescaling limit with µ   as we will showan equivalent procedure is to work with µ   but to construct the theory in termsof ψp t where p is the momentum conjugate to λwe have succeeded in mapping the collection of n nonrelativistic fermions whichdescribe the eigenvalues of φ onto an action which to leading order is just the twodimensional

the dasjevicki ﬁeldtheory assembles the correlation functions in a rather remarkable way each scatteringamplitude of the xquanta has to be multiplied by the external leg factors which arisebecause of the unusual form  of the external operators on the other handthese factors containing the poles have an important string theoretic meaning andcertainly cannot be discarded thus we are still missing the precise interpretation ofthe dasjevicki ﬁeld x in the string theory with euclidean signatureafter continuation of string amplitudes to the minkowski signature x  it theconnection with the dasjevicki ﬁeld theory is more straightforward the euclideanexternal leg factor for the operator t q is µqγqγq upon continuationq  ie this factor turns into a pure phase e expcidia subtle concept that

rate is not proportional to the spatialvolume that gives upon euclidean continuation the matrix model correlators todemonstrate this explicitly we will now calculate treelevel amplitudes for    and

conditiongx  gx + πrthat ensures the periodicity around the circle in this model we encounter a new setof physical issues related to the rdependence of the sum the c   conformal ﬁeldtheory is symmetric under the transformationαr when in the next section we consider the speciﬁc discretized sum generated by thematrix model we will be able to isolate the eﬀects of vortices in the matrix modeland will calculate the dual partition function in the vortexfree continuum limitin the conformal ﬁeld theory the target space duality  is generated by thedual transformation on the world sheetax  ǫabbx its lattice analogue is the transformation from the lattice λ to the dual lattice λrecall that when we sum over lattices λ we deﬁne the target space variables xi at thecenters of the faces of λ ie at the vertices of λ we will carry out a transformationafter which the new variables pi  are deﬁned at the vertices of λfirst to each directed link  ij  of λ associate the link  ij  of λ whichintersects it directed so that the cross product ij  ij points out of the surface ﬁg now we deﬁne dij  dij  xi  xj let us change variables in the integral so that the integral is over dij instead of xi there are e links but apart from thezero mode there are only v   independent xstherefore the dij s are not allindependent but must satisfy f   + h constraints the constraint associated witheach face is that phiji dij   where the sum runs over the directed boundary offrom each vertex of λ must vanish pj dij   similarly for each independentnoncontractable loop on λ of which there are h we ﬁnd ploop dij   in termsof λ this means that phiji ǫaij is nonzero only if thelink ij intersects the specially chosen noncontractable loop a on λ we direct theij   if ij  a points into the surface and  if it points outloop a and deﬁne ǫainsures that the net number ofa face of λ this is equivalent to the condition that the sum of the dij s emergingthe theorem of euler v  e + f    hindependent variables remains unchanged introducing lagrange multipliers pi forij dij   where the symbol ǫaeach face of λ and la for each noncontractable loop the integral over the variablesxi for each discretization of the surface can be replaced withdpi expipixjdijzhyadla expilaxhijiǫaij dij z yhijiz yiddij gdij z yiyadla yhijihdpigpi  pj + laǫaij where g is the fourier transform of g we see that after the transformation the lagrange multipliers pi assume the role of new integration variables residing atthe vertices of λ on surfaces of genus   there are h additional lintegrationsgeometrically speaking one introduces a cut on the surface along each canonicallychosen noncontractable loop so that the values of p undergo a discontinuity of laacross the ath cut and subsequently integrates over la on a sphere these additionalintegrations do not arise and one simply includes a factor gpi  pj  for each linkof the lattice λthe discussion above literally applies to the string on a real line when g isdeﬁned on a circle of radius r then the dual variables la and pi assume discretevalues nspacing r to conclude that r is equivalent to r is just as counterintuitive asto argue that theories with very small lattice spacing in target space have the samephysics as theories with enormous lattice spacing in section  we will directly studythe theory with the discrete target space we will show that if the lattice spacingis less than a critical value then the target space lattice is smoothed out but ifit exceeds the critical value then the theory drastically changes its properties thetwo phases are separated by a kosterlitzthouless phase transition equivalently inthe circle embedding the massless c   phase for r  rkt is separated by the kttransition from the disordered massive c   phase for r  rkt  the mechanismof this phase transition involves deconﬁnement of vorticesconsider a ﬁxed geometry ˆgµν and assume that in the continuum limit the actionreduces to eq  a vortex of winding number n located at the origin is describedby the conﬁgurationxθ  nrθwhere θ is the azimuthal angle this conﬁguration is singular at the origin the valuesof x have a branch cut in the continuum limit on a lattice however there is nosingularity and the vortex conﬁgurations are typically included in the statistical sumif we introduce lattice spacing phase the proliferation of vortices disorders x and makes its correlations short rangethe critical properties of this phase are those of pure gravity is there any way tosalvage the naive continuum limit the answer is yes but only at the expense ofﬁne tuning the model so that the vortices do not appear even on the lattice belowwe ﬁnd an explicit example of a model without vortices and show that it does exhibitthe r  r dualityfirst we have to give a clear deﬁnition of a vortex on a lattice loosely speakinga face i of lattice λ contains v units of vortex number if as we follow the boundary ofi the coordinate x wraps around the target space circle v times this does not quitedeﬁne the vortex number because x is only known at a few discrete points along theboundary and cannot be followed continuously in order to deﬁne vortex number ona lattice it is convenient to adopt the villain link factor gx xme we shall now change the deﬁnition of the partition function  to exclude thevortex conﬁgurations it is helpful to think of mij as link gauge ﬁelds the vortexnumbers vi deﬁned in eq  are then analogous to ﬁeld strengths if there are novortices the ﬁeld strength is zero everywhere however we still need to sum over allpossible windings around noncontractable loops on the lattice λ la  ploop a mijthus the space of mij we need to sum over ismij  ǫaijla + mi  mjwhere mi range over all integers and play the role of gauge transformations ǫaij

    "text": "introduction overviewin the neveuschwarzramond treatment of the superstringthe bosonic ghost of local worldsheet supersymmetry is necessary for the construction of spinor vertex operators and spacetime supersymmetry unfortunately the zeromode of this ghostcauses an ambiguity in the cohomology of the becchirouetstoratyutin operator fixing this ambiguity by choice of a pictureleads to improper ghost number assignments which must be ﬁxedby the insertion of picturechanging operatorsin the resultingstring ﬁeld theory these picturechanging operators appear in thekinetic terms in a way which mixes levels preventing a component analysis of the gaugeinvariant lagrangian the ospinvariant vacuum is not annihilated by one of the negativeenergy mass bosonic ghost oscillators γ so ghost statesof arbitrarily negative energy can be createdin a previous paper  such complications were avoided bya general method which can be applied to any brst formulation with unpaired unphysical bosonic

ﬁrstquantization corresponds to gauges with a propagating worldsheet gravitino all unintegrated vertex operators in the conformal ﬁeldtheory have ghost number onein particular even though thens hilbert space is essentially the same up to nonminimal ﬁeldsas in the usual treatment the vertex operators are unique areclosely analogous to those in the veneziano string and diﬀer fromthe usual choice because of a new unique choice of vacuumwe show the equivalence of general neveuschwarz npoint treeamplitudes to the usual results by applying conformal ﬁeld theory to our formulation in an

allowing component analysis and simple gaugeﬁxing the ns vertex is essentially the same as in wittensoriginal version of nsr superstring ﬁeld theory  except for thenonminimal coordinates however unlike that original versionthe nsr vertex is now the same as the ns one except thatagain the boundary conditions diﬀer the same supersymmetryoperator transforms ns to r ﬁelds as r to ns outlinein the following section we describe the relation between brstﬁrstquantization with vertex operators and zinnjustinbatalinvilkovisky secondquantization both methods can be applied toparticles as well as stringsin particular in yangmills theorythere is a vacuum state from which the physical states can beobtained by applying the vertex operator just as in string theoryin section  we consider the relation between these two methods in more detail for particles yangmills and the dirac spinorin particular we examine the nonminimal ﬁelds which will beused in the massless sector of the nsr string later we showhow this allows the choice of harmonic oscillator boundary conditions which provide a unique picture for the cohomology sothat the free dirac spinor action does not require picturechanginginsertions the ﬁelds obtained for this superyangmills systemyangmills+spinor resemble those found in the manifestly supersymmetric version of d n superyangmills the operatorformalism for interacting yangmills is also describedthe ﬁrstquantization of the free nsr string with nonminimalcoordinates is described in section  by starting with the hamiltonian formalism the desired result can be obtained without ﬁeldredeﬁnitions and with little modiﬁcation from the method usedfor the dirac spinor the conformal weights for the nonminimalcoordinates are arbitrary but match between the fermions and thebosons guaranteeing conformal anomaly cancellation similar remarks apply to choices of weights for ghosts in the greenschwarzstringinteractions for the ﬁrstquantized theory are treated in section  by the method of conformal vertex operators we describesome general relations between the integrated and unintegratedforms of these operators which apply for our generalizations of theconformal gauge in the neveuschwarz sector the vertex operators can be written without the use of bosonization the physicalones are independent of the nonminimal coordinates and so canalso be written in worldsheet superspace to treat ramond vertex operators and to relate our picture to the usual osp picturewe give the form of bosonization corresponding to our harmonicoscillator boundary conditionsin section  we give the supersymmetry operator since inour picture all unintegrated integrated vertices have ghost number   so all string wave functionsﬁelds have ghost number from nsr and rns this is possible because as in manifestlyspacetime supersymmetric formulations of particle theories the second quantization via firstsupersymmetry generator contains the analog of both the θ brst cohomologyand pθ terms whereas the old formulation was more like thecomponent approach in that these two terms appeared in the twoin general ﬁrstquantized relativistic systems can be describedseparate transformations ie in two diﬀerent pictures as in theold formalism the supersymmetry transformation is linear in thestring ﬁeldswe discuss scattering amplitudes in section  and calculatethe general ns amplitude explicitly evaluating the ghost matrixcompletely by a hamiltonian brst operator q and a ghostnumber operator j q is of the form ghostconstraint +ghost terms where the ghosts and constraints are unphysicaloperators any of these operators which could have continuouseigenvalues must be paired up as creation and annihilation operators except for the constraint p + m  p + m  is treatedelements in practice the calculations do not diﬀer much from thediﬀerently because it is not a true constraintin the classicalfriedanmartinecshenkerknizhnik treatment the main conceptual diﬀerence is that the fmsk approach required two picturesfor any type of vertex operator as determined by ghost nummechanics lagrangian its lagrange multiplier is restricted to bepositive so the propagator is  p + m  not δp + m this may require the introduction of extra variables as nonminiber conservation modulo the anomaly on the other hand inmal terms of the form ab where a is a commuting cnumber and bour formalism the vertex operator is always in the same pictureanticommuting so a can be paired with the unpaired boson thatbut contains terms similar to those appearing in both pictures ofappears in the minimal part of the brst operator the physics of the system is then described by the cohomologyof q states ψi which satisfy the equation of motion qψi  modulo the gauge transformation δψi  qλi these states canbe classiﬁed by their ghost number which can take four values the fmsk approach as does the supersymmetry operator discussed above however only one type of term is chosen from anyparticular vertex operator because of the way the ghosts appearalthough ns amplitudes are slightly simpler than in the usual formulation amplitudes involving spinors are somewhat messier intheir ghost dependence and we just set up the formalism however the main problems in both formalisms are evaluating matrixelements of physical spin operators and deriving massive fermionvertex operatorsin section  we discuss the superstring ﬁeld theory the nsand r string ﬁelds appear identically except for the usual integervs halfinteger mode numbers bosonization is unnecessary sincethe ns and r hilbert spaces can be treated as independent bothstring ﬁelds are fermionic but gso picks out the right partsboth have the brst operator as kinetic operator without picturechanging insertions both use the same supersymmetry operatoras discussed earlier and both interaction terms nsr andns have the same operator insertion ψ  p + changing exponentials which appear in the superriemann surfacepictureformulation cancel when one uses unbosonized ghosts and vacuuain the physical picture this suggests that this form is one stepcloser than the old formalism to a covariantly quantized greenschwarz formalismin the ﬁnal section we state our conclusions including a fewconjectures based on some of the more detailed results discussedbelow zjbv quantizationthe antiﬁelds are the same ones that appear in zinnjustinbatalinvilkovisky quantization  the secondquantized formalism which follows from brst ﬁrstquantization  is equivalent tozjbv secondquantization  speciﬁcally if we expand a generalstate as ψi  ψ+i + ψi where bψ+i  cψi   c is theghost for p + m  and b is its canonical conjugate b c  then ψ+i corresponds to a ﬁeld while ψi corresponds to anantiﬁeld the hilbertspace inner

a state φihaφi hφbi  habirepresents the obvious bracket between two φis but with theunusual property of being fermionic because of the anticommutativity of integration over c as usual the hilbertspace

antihermitian and opposite statisticsthe s operator of the zjbv formalism isi  δji  ψis   vacuum and vertex operatorsall the statements above in this section apply equally well toparticles and strings bosons and fermions as an example consider yangmills theory the operator q can be obtained by theﬁrstquantized methods of the covariantized lightcone as for anyother free theory  the part of the cohomology at j   ﬁelds introduced by adding + instead of + are thus nonminimal and our treatment of the nsr superstring will be analogousfor example for yangmills this means starting with a

    "text": "introductionthe conference organizers have asked me to give a review survey of signiﬁcantdevelopments in superstring compactiﬁcation that have occurred in the last coupleof years since the last review papers that i wrote on this subject a great deal ofimpressive progress has been made and it will only be possible to survey a portion ofit the choice of topics is based mostly on what has caught my attention and what ihave been able to digest there are undoubtedly many important developments thatwill not be mentionedthe two main topics to be discussed are calabiyau compactiﬁcation and targetspace duality two important developments in calabiyau compactiﬁcation will bestressed the ﬁrst is the existence of holomorphic prepotentials that determine thekahler potentials that describe the moduli spaces m and m associated withcomplex structure deformations and kahler form deformations respectively the second is the remarkable mirror symmetry that associates a pair of calabiyau spaces tothe same  conformal ﬁeld theory they are related to one another by interchangeof the moduli spaces m and mthe most famous example of targetspace duality is the r  r symmetry associated with compactiﬁcation on a circle of radius r as with mirror symmetry thistransformation relates distinct geometries that are associated with the same conformal ﬁeld theory generalizations appropriate to toroidal compactiﬁcations have beenknown for some time and will be reviewed very brieﬂy the little bit that is knownabout such symmetries in the case of k and calabiyau space compactiﬁcation willalso be discussed an interesting proposal has been made to restrict the possibilities for lowenergy eﬀective actions that incorporate nonperturbative supersymmetrybreaking by the duality symmetriesrecently my interest in targetspace duality was reactivated by the realizationthat it can be viewed as a discrete symmetry group that is a subgroup of spontaneously broken continuous gauge symmetrieswhat has been referred to as localgauge symmetry this led me to propose that it could have a bearing on resolvingcertain deep problems associated with quantum gravity after reviewing some of thedisturbing allegations that are made about the inevitable consequences of reconcilinggeneral relativity and quantum mechanics i will discuss possible ways in which theymay be circumvented in string theorythe concluding section makes a plea to demonstrate to our experimental colleagues that our work is relevant it is suggested that a strong case could be made forsupersymmetry at the tev scale as an almost inevitable feature of any quasirealisticstring vacuum this being so perhaps it would not be inappropriate for us to stickour necks out a bit and call this a prediction of string theory progress in calabiyau compactiﬁcationlet me begin by recalling a few basic facts by deﬁnition a calabiyau spaceis a kahler manifold of three complex dimensions and vanishing ﬁrst chern classthe complex dolbeault cohomology groups h pq have dimensions bpq given by thehodge diamondbbbbone generator of h  is the kahler form j  igµνdxµ  dxν thus b  a calabiyau space with speciﬁed kahler class admits a unique ricciﬂat metricalso there exists a covariantly constant spinor λ in terms of which the holomorphicthreeform is ωµνρ  λγµνρλin the context of heterotic string compactiﬁcation the existence of λ is responsiblefor the fact that the d lowenergy theory has n supersymmetry altogether themassless spectrum contains the following n supermultipletsa n supergravity graviton and gravitinob yangmills supermultiplets adjoint vectors and spinors for e  e    c various chiral supermultiplets weyl spinor and a scalarthe chiral supermultiplets include matter and moduli multiplets the mattermultiplets consist of b generations  of e and b antigenerations by the formulagα β  rm χα  χ βthat f is a cubic function so that the yukawa couplings are constants whereas g isa complicated nonpolynomial expression so that those yukawa couplings depend onthe complex structure deformation modulia calabiyau space corresponds to a geometric limit of a  superconformalﬁeld theory this geometric limit includes eﬀects to every order in α in the associatedsigma model but it does not include the nonperturbative eﬀects associated withworldsheet instantons it turns out that these worldsheet instantons contribute tothe moduli space of kahler form deformations m but not to the moduli space ofcomplex structure deformations m as a result the prepotential g can be computedexactly in the geometric limit but the prepotential f cannot the earlier assertionthat f is a cubic function referred to the geometric limit when the instantonit is the latter expression that iscontributions are included it is no longer cubicrelevant to string theory this modiﬁcation of calabiyau geometry implied by thecorresponding conformal ﬁeld theory is sometimes referred to as quantum geometryin the recent literaturewe now turn to the mirror symmetry conjecture the similarity in the descriptionof the two moduli spaces m and m suggests that to every calabiyau space mwith b   there is a mirror partner calabiyau space m such that the two modulispaces are interchangedm  mandm  mclearly in view of the remarks made above this is only possible if we include theinstanton corrections in the description of the moduli spaces thus the precise statement of the conjecture is that there is a a mirror partner calabiyau space suchthat the two spaces correspond to distinct geometric limits of the same  conformal ﬁeld theory this a remarkable conjecture from a mathematical point of viewsince the cy spaces have completely diﬀerent geometries and topologies it is alsoof some practical importance from the physical point of view since computationsof the prepotentials are signiﬁcantly easier to carry out in the geometric limit using topological formulas than for the exact cft in general by computing modulispaces of complexstructure deformations for a pair of mirror cy spaces one deducesby the equations above the exact geometry of the moduli spaces of kahler formdeformations including the eﬀects of worldsheet instantonsa considerable amount of evidence in support of the mirror symmetry conjecturehas been amassed i am not completely sure of the history but i believe the ideaoriginated when dixon noticed the symmetrical way in which generations and antigenerations are treated in calabiyau compactiﬁcation of the heterotic string a lagepner and when lerche vafa and warner noticed the symmetrical appearanceof the cc and ac rings in n landauginzburg theory candelas lynkerand schimmrigk computed the hodge numbers b and b for several thousand cyspaces that can be described as intersections of weighted complex projective spacesand observed that there was an almost perfect correspondence between pairs of cyspaces with these numbers interchanged some unpaired examples are to be expectedin their list since it is certainly not complete given that fact it is remarkable howfew of them there are also one class of spaces is certainly special there existcalabiyau spaces with b   the mirror of such a space should have b   butsuch a space cannot be a calabiyau space since they always have the kahler formitself as at least one generator of h  the signiﬁcance of this class of exceptions isbeing investigated by the experts it may be of some practical importance if we hopeto eventually ﬁnd an example that gives three generations and no antigenerations soas to avoid the problem of understanding how extra generations and antigenerationspair up to acquire a large mass such a space with b   and b   might notexist howeverfurther evidence in support of the mirror symmetry conjecture and insight intovarious structural details have been obtained from a variety of additional studiesthese include analysis of explicit examples based on  orbifolds and additionalstudies of the landauginzburg connection another approach utilizes gepners correspondence between calabiyau compactiﬁcation and compactiﬁcation of type iisuperstring theories the constructions based on type iia and type iib theoriesturn out to be related by mirror symmetry this fact provides a rather powerful toolfor detailed studies since it beneﬁts from the restrictions implied by the additionalsupersymmetry of the type ii theories finally i should mention the detailed investigation of a speciﬁc mirror pair of cy spaces by candelas et al they compute theprepotential f for the onedimensional moduli space of the kahler class for the cyspace given by a quintic polynomial in p and compare it to the prepotential g forthe mirror space given by orbifolding the original space by a suitable discrete symmetry group by comparing the two expressions they are able to explicitly identifythe instanton contributions and infer the number of holomorphic curves of varioussortsdeep results in algebraic geometry target space dualitythe notion of target space duality is becoming a more and more prevalent themein string theory with a wide range of applications and implications targetspacedualities are discrete symmetries of compactiﬁed string theories whose existence suggests a breakdown of geometric concepts at the planck scale the simplest exampleis given by closed bosonic strings with one dimension of space taken to form a circleof radius r in this case the momentum component of a string corresponding to thisdimension is quantized p  nr n  z this is a general consequence of quantummechanics and is not special to strings of course what is special for strings is theexistence of winding modes a closed string can wrap m times around the circulardimension a string state with momentum and winding quantum numbers n and mrespectively receives a zeromode contribution to its masssquared given bym   nr + mrαwhere α is the usual regge slope parameterit is evident that the simultaneousinterchanges r  αr and m  n leaves the mass formula invariant in fact theentire physics of the interacting theory is left unaltered provided that one simultaneously rescales the dilaton ﬁeld whose expectation value controls the string couplingconstant according to φ  φ  lnrand αr both correspond to the same c   conformal ﬁeld theory and it is theconformal ﬁeld theory that determines the physics this is the simplest example ofthe general phenomenon called targetspace dualitythe circular compactiﬁcation described above has been generalized to the caseof a ddimensional torus characterized by d constants gab and bab the symmetric matrix g is the metric of the torus while b is an antisymmetric matrix theseparameters describe the moduli space of toroidal compactiﬁcation and can be interpreted as the vacuum expectation values of d massless scalar ﬁelds the dynamicsof the toroidal string coordinates x a is described by the world sheet actions  z dσgabαx aαx b + ǫαβbabαx aβx bin this case we can introduce dcomponent vectors of integers ma and na to describethe winding modes and discrete momenta respectively a straightforward calculationthen gives the zeromode contributionsm   gabmamb + gabna  bacmcnb  bbdmdwhere gab represents the inverse of the matrix gab the onedimensional case isrecovered by setting g  rα and b   the generalization of the dualitysymmetry becomes g + b  g + b and φ  φ  the od d z target space duality symmetries are discrete remnants of spontaneously broken gauge symmetries speciﬁcally for values of the moduli corresponding to a ﬁxed point of a subgroup of this discrete group the corresponding stringbackground has enhanced gauge symmetrythis is most easily demonstrated byshowing that there are additional massless vector string states in the spectrum atsuch a point some of the duality symmetry transformations coincide with ﬁnite gaugetransformations by considering all possible such ﬁxed points it is possible to identifyan inﬁnite number of distinct gauge symmetries with all but a ﬁnite number of themspontaneously broken for any particular choice of the modulione may wonder whether the occurrence of targetspace dualities is special totoroidal compactiﬁcation or whether it occurs generically for curved compactiﬁcation spaces such as calabiyau manifolds the fourdimensional analog namelyk compactiﬁcation has been analyzed in some detail in that case applied tothe heterotic string the moduli space is o o o parametrized by massless scalar ﬁelds and the duality group is o  z remarkably this is exactlythe same manifold and duality group that arises in the case of toroidal compactiﬁcation of the heterotic string to six dimensions one might be tempted to speculate thatthe two compactiﬁcations are equivalent but that cannot be correct since k compactiﬁcation breaks half of the supersymmetry while toroidal compactiﬁcation doesnot break any by modding out certain symmetries of the torus it is possible toform an orbifold for which half the supersymmetry is broken and the moduli space isstill essentially the same this orbifold seems likely to correspond at least locally tothe same conformal ﬁeld theory as k having spaces of distinct topology correspondto identical conformal ﬁeld theories goes beyond what we learned from tori therevarious diﬀerent geometries all having the same topology were identiﬁed howeveras we have seen such identiﬁcations do exist for calabiyau spaces which occur inmirror pairs of opposite euler numberthe moduli space of a calabiyau compactiﬁcation factorizes into the manifoldm that describes complexstructure deformations times the manifold m thatdescribes kahler form deformations there are duality symmetry transformationsthat act on each of these spaces separately the two classes of transformations wouldseem to have very diﬀerent interpretations from a geometrical point of view howeverthe two factors are interchanged for the mirror manifold so if one associates themwith a mirror pair of calabiyau spaces then they appear on an equivalent footingthe problem is to determine the targetspace duality group that acts on each of thesemoduli spaces a natural action of the discrete group sp + b z can be deﬁnedon the third cohomology grouph   h   h   h   h analogous to the symplectic modular group for riemann surfaces this symplecticgroup contains the possible discrete symmetries of m the mirror symmetry impliesa corresponding action of sp + b z on the spaceh   h   h   h describing possible discrete symmetries of m thus altogether the target space duality of the quantum corrected calabiyau space should be given by some subgroupgt d  sp + b z  sp + b zexamples have been worked out in special casesa potentially important application of the duality symmetries has been proposedin connection with the construction of lowenergy eﬀective actions the idea is thatthese should be exact symmetries of the complete quantum theory and should still bepresent even after nonperturbative eﬀects such as those that break supersymmetryare taken into account and after heavy ﬁelds are integrated out this means that interms of a lowenergy eﬀective action in four dimensions with n supersymmetrythe duality symmetries should be realized on the superpotential which is thereforerestricted to be a suitable automorphic function this is a very signiﬁcant restrictionon the characterization of the lowenergy theory therefore there is some hope forsaying quite a bit about nonperturbative eﬀects without solving the diﬃcult problemof computing them from ﬁrst principles there is some evidence that the combination of gluino condensation and duality symmetry are suﬃcient to remove all ﬂatdirections from the potential this means that the size of the compact space whichis one of the moduli is dynamically determined and all the other parameters thatdetermine the vacuum conﬁguration are also determined supersymmetry is brokenand the cosmological constant typically comes out negative corresponding to anti desitter space however there are some examples for which the cosmological constantvanishes recently there have been studies of automorphic prepotentials for general compactiﬁcations conceptual challenges in reconciling gravity and quantum mechanicsthere are a variety of technical and conceptual obstacles that need to be overcomeif a satisfactory understanding of the reconciliation of general relativity and quantummechanics is to be achieved these can be divided into two categoriesamazingrequirements and distasteful allegations if string theory is the correct approach toconstructing a fully consistent uniﬁcation of all fundamental forces then it shouldhold the keys to the right answersin this case our job is to discern the clevertricks that string theory employs this may sound like a strange way to approachthe problem but string theory has proved to be a fruitful source of inspiration in thepast examples range from the discovery of supersymmetry to unexpected anomalyand divergence cancellation mechanisms and much more it could hold many moresurprises in store for usone amazing requirement is perturbative ﬁniteness or renormalizability thisis not yet fully established but there is considerable evidence that this is achievedin string theory even though it is apparently impossible for any pointparticle ﬁeldtheory that incorporates general relativity in four dimensions a second requirementis that causality have a precise meaning when the spacetime metric is a dynamicalquantum ﬁeld this undoubtedly happens in string theory but it would be nice tounderstand in detail just what is involved third the theory should be applicableto the entire universe perhaps describing it by a single wave function an obviousquestion in this connection is whether string theory suggests some special choice ofboundary condition such as that proposed by hartle and hawking and whether thiscould provide a rationale for selecting a particular vacuum conﬁgurationthe second category of conceptual issues consists of certain distasteful allegations which string theory might cleverly evade the ﬁrst of these is the claim thateﬀects associated with virtual black holes cause pure quantum states to evolve intomixed states if this were true it would mean that the entire mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is inadequate it seems reasonable to explore whetherstring theory could avoid allowing pure states to evolve into mixed states to the extent that string theory can be consistently formulated as an s matrix theory it seemsalmost inevitable that this should work out a second distasteful allegation is thatwormhole contributions to the euclidean path integral render the parameters of particle physics stochastic in a previous paper i referred to this phenomenon as thecurse of the wormhole since it would imply that even when the correct microscopictheory is known it will still not be possible to compute experimental parameters suchas coupling constants mass ratios and mixing angles from ﬁrst principlesa third issue concerns the classiﬁcation of black holes according to the nohair theorems in classical general relativity black holes are fully characterized bymass electric charge and angular momentum on the other hand they have a largeentropy that is proportional to the area of the event horizon this amount of entropycorresponds to a number of degrees of freedom that is roughly what one would get froma vibrating membrane just above the horizon in fact t hooft has tried to makesense of such a physical picture interpreting the membrane as a string world sheetalternatively the black hole degrees of freedom might be accounted for in stringtheory in more subtle ways that utilize possibilities for evading the classical nohairtheorems by quantum eﬀects recent studies have shown that black holes can havequantum hair which is observable in principle by generalized bohmaharonovinterference measurements charges that can characterize quantum hair for blackholes are precisely the same ones whose conservation cannot be destroyed by wormholeeﬀects thus the nicest outcome might be for the correct fundamental theory toprovide so many diﬀerent types of quantum hair as to produce precisely the numberof degrees of freedom that is required to account for the entropy of black holes ina theory with enough distinct degrees of freedom to account for black hole entropyand to protect quantum coherence there should be no deleterious eﬀects due towormholesa mechanism that has been proposed as an origin for quantum hair is for a continuous gauge symmetry to break spontaneously leaving a discrete subgroup unbrokenas we have discussed string theory has a large group of discrete symmetries that canbe understood as remnants of spontaneously broken gauge symmetries namely thetarget space dualities this fact led me to propose that these are the relevant symmetries for understanding quantum hair in string theory studies and discussions with others it has become clear that this suggestion has sehowever following furtherrious problems mostly stemming from the fact that these symmetries are almost allbroken for any particular choice of vacuum conﬁgurationthe ﬁrst proposal for quantum hair of black holes detectable only by bohmaharonovtype interference eﬀects was put forward a few years ago by bowick et alas initially formulated the analysis only applied to theories containing a masslessaxion however a subsequent paper demonstrated that this restriction was notessential and that a suitable massive axion could do the same jobstripping away all interactions the basic idea can be explained quite simplyassume fourdimensional spacetime and let aµ be a u vector ﬁeld and bµν anantisymmetric tensor gauge ﬁeld called the axion in the language of forms theassociated ﬁeld strengths are given by h  db and f  da the action consistsof the usual kinetic terms schematically given by skin  dh  mf and df  mh imply that both ﬁelds have mass m what happens isthat the antisymmetric tensor eats the vector to become massive in four dimensionsit is equivalent to say that the vector eats the scalar which is dual to bµν to becomemassivethe axion charge in a region of threedimensional space v with boundary v isdeﬁned byqaxion  zh  zbvvfor a spacetime with nontrivial second homology such as schwarzschild spacetimewhose topology is sr it is possible to obtain nonzero axion charge while havingthe h ﬁeld vanish outside some central region in this case the b ﬁeld on the enclosingtwosurface is proportional to a twoform that is closed but not exact ie belongsto the second cohomology group in a theory with axions there are strings cosmicor fundamental that contribute a term to the action proportional to rς bµν dxµ dxν as a result a world sheet enclosing a black hole with axionic charge givesa bohmaharonov phase expπiqaxion this makes the charge observable throughinterference eﬀects modulo unity if there were nontrivial third homology the axioncharge itself would be quantized and nothing would be observable however this isnot the case for a schwarzschild black holein the string theory context the formula for the ﬁeld strength h is embellishedby various chernsimons terms that were omitted in the discussion above alsooneloop eﬀects in ten dimensions give contributions to the eﬀective action of thepactiﬁcation it can happen that the tendimensional gauge ﬁelds acquire expectationform r b  trf  which play a crucial role in anomaly cancellation upon comvalues that result in a nonvanishing eﬀective term of the form r b  f  where f isa u gauge ﬁeld in four dimensions as required to give mass to the axion thishappens when the associated u gauge symmetry in four dimensions appears to beanomalous by the usual criteria based on triangle diagrams however as in ten dimensions bµν has nontrivial gauge transformation properties that give compensatingcontributions and render the quantum theory consistentaxion charge appears to be a good candidate for quantum hair in string theoryof course if this particular charge were the only type of quantum hair in stringtheory we would still be very far from achieving the goal of ﬁnding enough quantumdegrees of freedom to account for all the entropy of black holes and overcoming theother problems in quantum gravity that we have discussedfortunately string theory seems to allow various categories of generalizations ofaxion charge that could provide many more kinds of quantum hair for examplethe ﬁeld bµνx y is deﬁned in ten dimensions here x refers to fourdimensionalspacetime and y to six compactiﬁed dimensions in the usual kaluzaklein fashionthis represents an inﬁnite family of fourdimensional ﬁelds bnµν x corresponding toan expansion in harmonics of the compact space of the form p cnybnanalysis above only utilized the axion corresponding to the leading term in this seriesµν x thefor which cy is a constant the other terms describe ﬁelds that naturally havemasses of the order of the compactiﬁcation scale it seems plausible that they couldprovide additional types of quantum hairwhen the analysis is done carefullytargetspace duality may yet prove to be important even this inﬁnite collectionof charges may not be the end of the story the massive string spectrum containsan inﬁnite number of gauge ﬁelds of every possible tensor structure the particulargauge ﬁeld bµν is special by virtue of its coupling to the string world sheet whichplayed a crucial role in the reasoning above other gauge ﬁelds enter the world sheetaction with couplings given by their associated vertex operators for ﬁelds that arenot massless in ten dimensions these give nonrenormalizable couplings in the sigmamodel and are therefore diﬃcult to analyze still from a more general string ﬁeldtheory point of view they are not really very diﬀerent and so there may be manymore possibilities for quantum hair associated with the massive string spectrumin addition to string symmetries altering some consequences of general relativityat the quantum level it is also possible that special features of string theory play animportant role at the classical level one indication of this appears in a recent studyof charged black holes where eﬀects of the dilaton ﬁeld make qualitative changesalready at zeroth order in α speciﬁcally whereas a reissnernordstrom black holeof mass m and charge q has its horizon at the radius rh  m + punderstanding supersymmetry broken at the weak scale is required by string theoryin fact the experimental prospects are beginning to look up the requirementthat the three couplings of the standard model should become equal at a uniﬁcationscale fails badly without supersymmetry on the other hand for a susy scale rangingfrom  gev to  tev they merge very nicely at about  gev while this is farfrom conclusive it is a very impressive bit of evidence given the present experimentalsituation together with various theoretical and astrophysical considerations it seemsquite plausible that the lightest supersymmetry particles are at the low end of thisrange others such as squarks and gluinos maybe be around a tev or so if this iscorrect it is unlikely that any of these particles will be produced and detected beforethe lhc or ssc comes on line however supersymmetry has important implicationsfor the higgs sector that could be conﬁrmed soonerlowenergy supersymmetry has two higgs doublets which after symmetry breaking result in a charged particle h  and three neutral particles h h and a theminimal supersymmetric standard model mssm requires at tree level that h isthe lightest of these and that its mass not exceed mz when radiative correctionsare taken into account it can be somewhat heavier depending on the mass of thetop quark for example if the top quark mass does not exceed  gev then the hmass should not exceed  gev for a top quark mass below  gev the boundis lowered to  gev these bounds need not be saturated so there is a reasonablechance for a mass in the range  gev making it open to discovery at lep another interesting possibility is that the top quark could decay into h + plus abottom quark if it is kinematically allowed this could be a signiﬁcant branchingfraction the precise prediction depends on the parameter tanβ  vv i amoptimistic that some of these particles will turn up during this decade and that thiswill open up an exciting era for string theorists as well as all particle

    "text": "introductionthe problem we address in this letter arises quite naturally in the socalled free ﬁeldapproach to conformal ﬁeld theories the mathematical question one wants to answerwithin this framework is whether a given irreducible module l of the chiral algebra a hasa resolution in terms of fock spaces more precisely one wants to construct a family of freeﬁeld fock spaces f i which are amodules and a set of ahomomorphisms intertwinersdi  f i  f i+ such that these spaces with the maps between them form a complexwhose cohomology is isomorphic to l the ﬁrst example of such a construction wasgiven by felder  for the class of representations of the virasoro algebra corresponding tominimal models  later this was extended to other conformal ﬁeld theories in particularwznw and their coset models for review see  and references thereinfelders construction relies on the complete classiﬁcation of submodules of fock spacesgiven by feigin and fuchs  and the explicit form of the intertwiners the latter aredeﬁned following thorn  as multiple integrals of products of the screening currents onemay wonder whether the restriction to the representations in the fundamental range of theminimal series is important the answer turns out to be negative and already examplesof similar resolutions outside this series have been discussed in  in the following we willargue that a fock space resolution can be explicitly constructed for any irreducible highestweight module of the virasoro algebra provided one introduces additional intertwinersbesides those considered in  the existence of such intertwiners and their propertiesneeded in the computation of the cohomology were demonstrated by tsuchiya and kanie we will discuss some of their results within the dotsenkofateev formalism  asused in  which may be more familiar not to make our presentation too long we willrestrict to modules with c  our three main results which cover the cases not analyzed previously are summarizedin theorems   and in particular the ﬁrst gives the resolution for modulescorresponding to the socalled boundary of the kac table  whilst the last extendsfelders construction to modules outside the fundamental rangethis letter is organized as follows in section  as well as introducing some deﬁnitionsand notation we summarize the results of feigin and fuchs which will be used laterthen in sections  and  we introduce intertwiners and recall the construction of felderscomplex after this review we discuss the boundary case in detail in sections  and  andin section  describe

vectors vi become singular and generatef which is a direct sum of irreducible highest weight modules note that v is specialsince it is singular finally wi are singular in ff and generate a direct sum ofirreducible highest weight modules the arrows    indicate that the second vector isin the submodule generated by the ﬁrst onethere are also similar diagrams for the composition series of singular vectors of theverma modules in which the singular vectors occur at precisely the same conformal weightsas above moreover some arrows must be reversed so that all of them describe embeddingsof the verma submodules the intertwinerslet us ﬁrst introduce a class of intertwiners between fock spaces they are constructedas products of the screening currentss+z  expiin explicit computations one needs to have convenient representatives of these homology classes we will construct them using the following two classes of multicontourssingular at a point that have been used in  in the ﬁrst class which we denoteγk the integration variables z     zk are taken counterclockwise from  to  around and nested according to z      zk in the second bγk the z integration is along acontour surrounding  while z    zk are integrated counterclockwise from the base pointz to z around  and the nesting is the same as in γk the ambiguity in the phase of theintegrand  is ﬁxed by analytic continuation from the positive real halfline see let us denote the resulting operators  by q+r  respectivelyr  qwe will also consider multiple contours obtained by putting several of those togetherfor example γkγk will denote a multiple contour z    zk    zk+k in which the variablesof γk are nested inside those of γkr and bq+r  bqwe may now state the main result about the intertwiners between feiginfuchs modules of

weights of ui and vi in fm+jp areprecisely those of the vectors generating submodules of the fock space fmj+p  letus denote the latter vectors by ui vi i   this observation and  reduce the problemof constructing a resolution to that of ﬁnding a homomorphism d from fmj+p intofm+jp  such that dui  ui and dvi  vi i   note that then d must be injective ieit is an embeddingin a sense the problem is

izerginkorepin ik model   his results can besummarized as follows the rmatrix of the ik model cannot be directly interpretedas the smatrix of the massive excitations of the perturbed cft because introducing ahilbert space structure it does not satisfy the unitarity requirement but it is possibleto use the quantum slq symmetry of the ik model to study the rsos restrictionof the hilbert space

ﬁeld remaining ﬁelds in the representation are given by successive operator products with the stressenergy tensortogether all these ﬁelds comprise a representation φn in terms of modes thedescendant ﬁelds are obtained by commuting lns with primary ﬁelds acting on the vacuum the descendant ﬁelds create descendant states we shall seethat the conformal ward identities give diﬀerential equations that determinethe correlation functions of descendant ﬁelds in terms of those of primariesthe utility of organizing a two dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory in terms ofconformal families ie irreducible

representation theory of thevirasoro algebra thus resembles that of su  with l playing the role of j and the lns playing the roles of an inﬁnite number of jswe also wish to show that every state in a positive hilbert space can beexpressed as a linear combination of primary and descendant states supposenot ie suppose that there exists a state λi that is not a descendant of a highestweight state then in a positive metric theory we can decompose λi  δi+ψiwhere ψi is orthogonal to all descendants δi if ψi has l eigenvalue hψ letk  hψ the greatest integer part now consider some order k combinationof the lnis such thatp ni  k for any term symbolically denoted lk thenhi  lkψi is a highest weight state with h  hψk it must be annihilated byall the lns n   since otherwise they would create a state with h   butwe also have hhhi  hψlkhi   since hψ is orthogonal to all descendantsit follows that hi   we next consider the state lkψi  h + i wherelk is order k   in the lns the same argument as above shows thath + i too must be highest weight but have zero norm and consequently mustvanish by induction we ﬁnd that ψi itself is a highest weight state concludingthe argumentwith this characterization of the hilbert space of states in hand we turnto a more detailed consideration of the state representations of the virasoroalgebra via the correspondence between states and ﬁelds we could equallyproceed in terms of the ﬁelds  but framing the discussion in terms ofstates turns out to be slightly more convenient for our purposes starting froma highest weight state hi we build the set of stateslevelso that the central charge must satisfy c  ah h  h hh + we conclude that a highest weight state hi of the virasoro algebra at this valueof c satisﬁescidl the determinant has an odd number of negative eigenvalues ie at least onethe representation of the virasoro algebra at those values of c and h includesstates of negative norm and is consequently not unitarythe formula generalizing bdet mn c h  αn ypqnh  hpqcp npq ais due to kac and was proven in  the product in a is over all positiveintegers p q whose product is less than or equal to n  and αn is a constant

pottsmodel for example useful in studying percolation is not described by a localorder parameter and is not a unitary theory the yanglee edge singularityalso appears in a nonunitary theory in this case due to the presence of animaginary ﬁeldthe analysis of unitary representations of the virasoro algebra proceedsfrom a study of the kac determinant  as mentioned in the previoussubsection if the determinant is negative at any given level it means that thereare negative norm states at that level and the representation is not unitaryif the determinant is greater than or equal to zero further investigation candetermine whether or not the representation at that level is unitaryin the region c   h   it is easy to see that there are no zeroes ofthe kac determinant  at any level for   c   m is not real and thehpqs of b either have an imaginary part or for p  q are negative forc   we can choose the branch   m   and ﬁnd that all the hpqs arenegative now we can show that the nonvanishing of det mn in this regionimplies that all the eigenvalues of mn are positive this is because for h largethe matrix becomes dominated by its diagonal elements as shown at the endof the previous subsection these are highest order in h since these matrixelements are all positive the matrix has all positive eigenvalues for large h butsince the determinant never vanishes for c   h   all of the eigenvaluesmust stay positive in the entire regionon the boundary c   the determinant vanishes at the points h  nbut does not become negative thus the kac determinant  poses no obstacle in principle to having unitary representations of the virasoro algebra forany c   h  only the region   c   h   is delicate to treat although all steps inthe argument are elementary first we draw the vanishing

restrict to operators with p + q even  this selects operators ina checkerboard pattern starting from the identity operator at lower leftsymmetry group of a physical system has been identiﬁed the analysis of itsspectrum and interactions is frequently reduced to a straightforward exercise ingroup representation theory and branching rules for a given critical statisticalmechanical model the point correlation functions allow an identiﬁcation ofthe scaling weights of the operators in the theory and in many cases that issuﬃcient to identify the relevant representation of the virasoro algebra wehave already mentioned that the discrete unitary series with c   for exampleprovides a set of possibilities for d critical behavior that can be matched upwith that of known statistical mechanical systemswe shall now make explicit the identiﬁcation of the ﬁrst member of thediscrete unitary series ie the case m   with c   with the ising modelat its critical point up to now we have

the divergence of the speciﬁc heatc  tα near the critical pointnow according to the scaling hypothesis the divergence of all thermodynamic quantities at the critical point is due to their dependence

    "text": "introductioni have been asked to review the current status of an approach to quantum gravitywhich is being developed by abhay ashtekar and his colleagues carlo rovelli lee smolinand others i should emphasize that i have not actively worked on this approach and asa result my knowledge of it is somewhat incomplete however i have followed the progressin this area and would like to describe for you the main ideas involved the current statusand open problemsashtekar and colleagues are trying to quantize standard four dimensional general relativity without supersymmetry higher derivatives extra dimensions extended objects etcthe ﬁrst question that probably comes to mind is why are they wasting their time on aprogram that is doomed to failure isnt it well known that general relativity cannot bequantized perhaps surprisingly the answer is no it is of course known that generalrelativity is not perturbatively renormalizable but unlike the case for most quantumﬁeld theories this may not be as bad as it sounds general relativity is qualitatively different from other ﬁeld theories in that the dynamical ﬁeld is the spacetime metric onemight even argue that standard ﬁeld theory perturbation techniques should break downsince they are based on the assumption that spacetime looks minkowskian at arbitrarilyshort distances which is not very plausible in quantum gravity as i will describe thereare indications that quantum general relativity provides a natural cutoﬀ at the planckscaleashtekar works in the framework of canonical quantization thus it is analogous to thefunctional schroedinger representation for ordinary ﬁeld theories however as we willsee the reparameterization invariance of general relativity leads to certain simpliﬁcationscanonical quantization of general relativity has of course been tried before but previousinvestigations have almost always used the spatial three metric and its conjugate momentum as the basic canonical variables this leads to constraints which are diﬃcult to solveor even make sense of in the quantum theory ashtekar instead chooses canonical variables which are analogous to those in ordinary gauge theories the resulting constraintsare simpler and more progress can be made toward constructing the quantum theoryto motivate ashtekars choice of canonical variables we begin by considering generalrelativity in three dimensions this theory can be described in terms of an so connection ωabµ the spacetime metric is deﬁned in terms ofthe triad by gµν  eaµ and a triad of dual vectors eaν ηab the action isµebs  z ea  rbc ǫabcwhere r  dω + ω  ω is the curvature two form or ﬁeld strength of ω this action infact describes a slight extension of general relativity when eaµ consists of three linearlyindependent vectors one can show that  is equivalent to the usual einstein actionr rwith one having  complex components however closer examination reveals that theconsequences are much deeper than thatthis is most easily seen in the euclidean context the euclidean einstein equationscan be obtained from the action  with either an so connection or its self dual partaµ which is a real su connection thus one can eliminate half of the components of theconnection without losing any information the reason is basically that the two actionsdiﬀer by a term proportional to r rµνρσ which does not contribute since one retains thefull tetrad one has the spacetime metric and in any solution one can always reconstructthe complete connection and its curvature in addition to the obvious economy of ﬁeldsthere are further advantages to working with aµ for example one can show that einsteinsﬁeld equation with arbitrary cosmological constant is equivalent to the self dual yangmills equation for the connection aµ more precisely it is equivalent to the self dualyangmills equation in a curved background where aµ is equal to the self dual part of thespin connection using this correspondence one can ﬁnd gravitational analogs of suyangmills instantons the one instanton solutions turn out to correspond to the foursphere with the size of the instanton related to the radius of the spherereturning to the lorentzian context one ﬁnds further advantages of using the self dualconnection when one constructs the canonical formulation of the theory the dynamicalvariables are the spatial components of the connection ai and its conjugate momentum eiwhich contains the information on the tetrad the constraints are all ﬁrst class and takethe formdiei  tr fijei  tr fijeiej  since ai is complex there is also a reality condition that must be imposed the ﬁrstconstraint is the standard gauss law constraint of yangmills theory thus every initialdata set for general relativity is also an initial data set for an su yangmills theory theonly diﬀerence is that it is also subject to four additional constraints which are related toreparameterization invariance note that the degrees of freedom match su yangmillstheory has      degrees of freedom at each point which are reduced to  by thefour additional constraints it should be emphasized that even though the initial data issimilar the hamiltonian for general relativity is very diﬀerent than yangmills theory asin the three dimensional case reparameterization invariance ensures that the hamiltonianfor general relativity is just a multiple of the constraints up to a surface term at inﬁnitynotice that all the constraints are simple polynomials in the basic ﬁelds the realitycondition is also polynomial this is one of the main reasons that this approach initiallyattracted so much attention but just from the form of the constraints it is diﬃcult to tellhow much of an advance this represents polynomial equations do not of course implythat the quantum theory is necessarily solvable or even exists although the standardconstraints in terms of the spatial metric and conjugate momentum are not polynomialthey can be made so by simply multiplying by appropriate powers of the determinant ofthe metric furthermore the constraint  is quadratic in the momenta which meansthat the corresponding operator involves functional derivatives at the same point and mustbe regulated this was also true in the old variables and was perhaps the main diﬃcultyin ﬁnding solutions to the quantum constraints to see the real advantage of this form ofthe constraints one must begin to construct the quantum theoryclassically the gauss law constraint  generates gauge transformations just as in anygauge theory one can show that the vector constraint  generates reparameterizations ofthe three dimensional surface and the scalar constraint  is related to reparameterizationsof time or motions of the spatial surface in the four dimensional solution to constructthe quantum theory we begin by representing states by functionals of ai we wish to turnthe classical constraints into quantum operators by replacing ei by iδδai and deﬁnephysical states to be those annihilated by the quantum constraints this of course requiresa choice of factor ordering for the constraints linear in the momenta the ordering givenin  and  ensures that the quantum constraints have a similar action as their classicalcounterparts however the quantum scalar constraint  has no direct interpretationsince as we have already mentioned it must be regulated jacobson and smolin haveshown that there exists a regulated form of this constraint cδ and a class of states ψγparameterized by a loop γ such thatcδ ψγ  limδthe regulator is a type of point splitting in which the functional derivatives are evaluatedat diﬀerent points separated by a distance δ the states are just the familiar wilson loopsgiven a nonselfintersecting smooth closed curve γ setψγa  t rp ehγaroughly speaking the reason this satisﬁes the constraint is that each δδai brings downa term proportional to the tangent vector to the curve both of these tangent vectors arecontracted into the antisymmetric fij and hence vanish this type of solution is possibleonly if one uses variables like ashtekars in which the momentum ei has two type of indicesthe tangent space index i and an internal index which we have suppressed although theconstraint  is symmetric under interchange of the two momentum as it must be it isantisymmetric under interchanging each type of index separatelythere are several reasons why one might feel uneasy about this result first since onemust introduce a notion of distance to regulate the constraint the regulator breaks threedimensional reparameterization invariance formally this invariance is restored as theregulator goes to zero but there is always the possibility of anomalies a related diﬃcultyis that cδψγ   for δ   thus in some sense the regulator breaks four dimensionalreparameterization invariance as well finally the regulated constraint is not unique atthe moment there are several proposals for the regulated constraint which appear to beinequivalentnevertheless this is a signiﬁcant achievement despite extensive work on the oldcanonical formalism for general relativity no one has ever achieved an analogous resultthe analog of the scalar constraint in the old variables is known as the wheelerdewittequation because of the diﬃculty in regulating and solving this equation extensive workwas done on simpler minisuperspace models in which one freezes out all but a ﬁnitenumber of degrees of freedom of the metric the full wheelerdewitt equation has neverbeen solvedeven more remarkable is the fact that the solutions to the analog of the wheelerdewitt equation are just the simple wilson loops these have long been considered asnatural gauge invariant variables for describing yangmills theory both classically andquantum mechanically the fact that these same objects solve the scalar constraint ofquantum general relativity is quite surprisingalthough ψγ solves the scalar and gauss law constraint it does not solve the vectorconstraint in a key development rovelli and smolin showed that one can obtain solutions to all quantum constraints by passing to a new representation in which states arefunctionals of loops this can be obtained formally by the integral transformationψγ  z da w γ a ψawhere the kernel is again the wilson loopw γ a  tr p ehγathis transforms functionals of a into functionals of loops alternatively the loop representation can be introduced directly by starting with an algebra of loop observablescomputing their poisson bracket and introducing operators on functionals of loops withthe same commutation relations one then expresses the constraints as operators in theloop representation since gauge invariance is automatic there is no analog of the gaussconstraint from the above discussion it might appear that there should be no analog ofthe scalar constraint either this would indeed be the case if one could restrict to onlysmooth nonselfintersecting loops on the one hand this sounds reasonable since all gaugeinvariant information in the connection is contained in the wilson loops for this class ofγ on the other hand to obtain a closed poisson bracket algebra for the loop observables it seems necessary to work with the larger space of all piecewise smooth loopsfortunately even in this larger space one can satisfy the scalar constraint by simply restricting the functionals to have support on just the smooth nonselfintersecting loopswe can now impose the vector constraint this says that the states are invariant underdiﬀeomorphisms of the three surface by deﬁnition the diﬀeomorphism class of a smoothnonselfintersecting loop is called a knot thus one is led to the remarkable result thatfunctions of knot classes satisfy all the constraints of quantum general relativity thisresult probably represents the main achievement of ashtekars program so farin order to be sure that these knot states are physical we must check that they arenormalizable this is nontrivial since the inner product cannot be chosen arbitrarily butmust be chosen so that physical observables are hermitian the classical reality conditionwill enter here unfortunately at the present time very few observables are known andhence the inner product has not yet been determined one might worry that since one startswith functions on the inﬁnite dimensional space of loops or connections the inner productwill necessarily be a functional integral which could only be evaluated perturbativelythis would violate the whole spirit of this nonperturbative approach to quantizationhowever one only needs the inner product on the solutions to the constraints which likethe knot states above might well have a countable basis in simpler models such as threedimensional gravity and the weak ﬁeld limit the loop representation and the innerproduct have been constructed with the result that the loop states are normalizable thislends support to the idea that they will be normalizable in the full theory as wellwe have not yet discussed the algebra of the quantum constraints if one ignores regularization and formally calculates the commutator of the quantum constraints one ﬁndsthat there exists a choice of factor ordering such that the algebra closes however beforethe discovery of the knot states there was little reason to trust this result since it wasshown that regularization has an important eﬀect on the operator algebra the calculation of the regulated constraint algebra has not yet been completed but the existenceof solutions to all the constraints shows that there can be no cnumber central extensioneither the constraints will close or the nonclosure will be a term which annihilates all theknot stateshow might one physically interpret these knot states work on this question is currently in progress one possibility is the following consider a collection of knots deﬁnedas follows take a ﬂat metric on r and draw three families of parallel nonintersectinglines separated by a distance a as shown in fig  now connect the ends at inﬁnity toform a knot this can be done in many inequivalent ways this collection of knots arecalled weaves a state which is one on these weaves and zero for all other knots might beinterpreted as representing the ﬂat euclidean metric on r one should state this moreprecisely since a knot is diﬀeomorphism invariant while a particular ﬂat metric is not thecorrect statement is that given a ﬂat metric one constructs a particular representativeof a knot class to describe it a diﬀeomorphism acting on the knot representative describes the new ﬂat metric obtained by applying the same diﬀeomorphism to the originalmetric preliminary calculations indicate that the physical spacing between the lines isdetermined by the theory to be the planck length if one considers the operator representing the metric and averages it over scales much larger than a then the weave state givesthe best approximation to the ﬂat metric for a equal to the planck length it is temptingto conjecture that other background metrics might correspond to topologically diﬀerentweaves roughly speaking given any metric on a three manifold one might associate aweave consisting of ﬁbers whose tangent vectors form an orthonormal basis for the givenmetric it is intriguing to see discrete structure at the planck scale emerge from the theory in the past many people have referred to the fabric of spacetime if these ideas arecorrect this phrase may have literal and not just literary meaningthe loop representation has also been explored for electromagnetism and linearizedgravity it can be constructed either by transforming the connection representation ordirectly in terms of loop observables in this case it suﬃces to consider simple unknottedloops the result is that for electromagnetism a one photon state with momentum k andpolarization ǫ is described by the following functional of loopsψγ  i dσǫj γjeikγthis is simply ψγ  hγ a where a is the wave function for the one photon state noticethat gauge invariance is automatically enforced by the line integral around the loop thestates of linear gravity are similar the main diﬀerence is that for linearized gravity thereare essentially three copies of the electromagnetic states since the self dual connection hasthree complex internal componentshow does one incorporate these linear states into the full theory one possibility is thefollowing for each simple loop γ one considers a knot consisting of the weave togetherwith the loop γ attached in a manner analogous to ordinary embroidery on fabric onenow deﬁnes a state by the condition that it equal ψγ on this knot and similarly for allpossible positions of the loop in the weave notice that in this picture gravitons do notmake sense on scales less than the background scale a any loop smaller than this will betopologically disconnected open questions and new directionsalthough the results that have been obtained so far are promising there is much thatremains to be done before one can claim to have a consistent quantum theory of gravitythis section is divided into three parts in the ﬁrst i consider some open questions in themain program described above the second includes a short discussion of other approachesto quantum gravity using ashtekar variablesin the third i consider the question ofwhether there exists yet another set of canonical variables for general relativity or atheory containing general relativity such that the constraints are simpliﬁed even further open questions in the main programwe have already discussed two important unresolved issues in ashtekars approach toquantum gravity one is to determine the physical inner product and show that the knotstates are normalizable the other is to understand better the regularization procedureare there principles which determine it uniquely does it lead to anomaliesone also needs to improve the physical interpretation of the knot states for examplecan a black hole be described in terms of functionals of knots since there is some indicationhow to interpret ﬂat space and linearized gravitons in terms of knot states one can nowbegin to consider gravitongraviton scattering this will be an important test of thisapproach to quantum gravity uncontrollable divergences will show that this approachsuﬀers from the same diﬃculties of standard quantum ﬁeld theory methods on the otherhand ﬁnite answers will be an important conﬁrmation of the basic principles underlyingthis approach a related issue is whether there exist other solutions to the quantumconstraints besides the knot states if one can work with a loop representation consistingonly of smooth nonselfintersecting loops it would appear that the answer is no if oneworks with the larger space of piecewise smooth loops then additional solutions can befoundso far i have only considered pure general relativity without matter the ﬁrst steptoward including matter is to show that the combined gravity matter system can be writtenin terms of the self dual connection in such a way that the constraints are still polynomialin the basic canonical variables this requires that the metric and its inverse cannot bothappear this step has been carried out for scalar spinor and gauge ﬁelds in particularthe action for supergravity has been written in terms of ashtekar variables the nextstep is to ﬁnd solutions to the quantum constraints in the presence of matter this is notwell understood it should be kept in mind that unlike superstring theory this approachdoes not at present provide a uniﬁed picture of all forces and matter its main advantageassuming it is successful is in staying as close as possible to the experimentally testedgeneral relativityif one considers general relativity with a cosmological constant λ then one solution toall of the quantum constraints turns out to beψa  escsλwhere scs is the chernsimons action for the self dual connection ai the calculationof the transform of this state into the loop representation is similar to the calculationperformed by witten which reproduced knot invariants one might worry that thisindicates that the knot states will not be normalizable if one considers the state  asa state in ordinary yangmills theory then for some choice of λ it turns out to be a zeroenergy eigenstate but it is outside of the physical hilbert space and hence appears to haveno physical signiﬁcance why should the situation for gravity be any better the key pointis that for gravity one is using self dual connections rather than real connections evenfor electromagnetism one can show that if one uses the self dual representation andei real then the chernsimons state is just the vacuum for one helicity of the photonthe vacuum for the other helicity is a constant these states are normalizable withrespect to the standard poincare invariant inner product this gives further evidence thatthe knot states are physicalas we have mentioned ashtekars approach to quantum gravity is similar in spirit tothe functional schroedinger approach to ordinary ﬁeld theory however the reparameterization invariance leads to the technical simpliﬁcation that one does not have to solve thetime dependent schroedinger equation since the hamiltonian is proportional to the constraints however this raises a conceptual problem how does one recover time and makephysical predictions this is one of the deep issues that every nonperturbative approachto quantum gravity must address it has been discussed extensively but there is still noclear answer simple models of reparameterization invariant systems suggest that one partof the argument of the wave function should play the role of time in ashtekars approachthere has been some progress in identifying time in the connection representation butnot much is known yet in the loop representation another possibility is that time willarise only when gravity is coupled to matter and physical clocks can be constructed other approaches to quantization with ashtekar variablesalthough canonical quantization with constraint operators has been the main focus ofwork in this area it may be worthwhile to examine other approaches one alternative is tosolve the constraints classically and then quantize the resulting true degrees of freedomthis was in fact the way witten ﬁrst quantized the + theory remarkably enoughthe general solution of the vector and scalar constraint can be expressed in terms of anarbitrary symmetric invertible traceless    matrix φabx given an arbitrary selfdual connection aai  deﬁne eia so thatij  ǫijkekf ab φabsubstituting this into the constraints one sees immediately that  is satisﬁed since φab issymmetric and  is satisﬁed since φab is tracefree one can argue that this is the generalsolution since φab has ﬁve independent components which is the number one expects aftersolving four equations for the nine components of eia gauss law is the only remainingi and φab unfortunately a simple solution to this equation is not yetconstraint on aaavailableanother possibility is to consider covariant approaches to quantization this shouldbe more conducive to answering a certain class of questions such as whether the topologyof space can change in quantum gravity even classically one has the following resultboth the action  and the one obtained by replacing r by the curvature of the self dualconnection a do not involve the inverse of the tetrad thus the action and the resultingﬁeld equations remain well deﬁned even in the limit that the metric becomes degeneratein general relativity it has been shown that any solution to the vacuum einstein equationwhich interpolates between spaces of diﬀerent topology must be singular but the onlysingularity that is required is for the metric to become degenerate at one moment of timethere exist smooth solutions to the equations derived from  which change topology andhave an invertible metric almost everywheresince ashtekars approach and the tetrad approach to general relativity both naturallyinclude degenerate metrics one is faced with the question of why the metric we see is invertible in fact it is not even clear how to formulate this question precisely it is temptingto consider the expectation value of the metric  gµν  and one often hears speculationthat  gµν   may correspond to a diﬀeomorphism invariant phase of quantum gravitywhile  gµν  ηµν corresponds to a state of broken symmetry however it is clear fromthe quantum constraints that the physical states of quantum general relativity are alwaysdiﬀeomorphism invariant moreover the expectation value of any nongauge invariant operator such as the metric must always be gauge invariant if u denotes a general gaugetransformation then ψgµνψ  ψugµνuψ since physical states are gauge invariant as there are no nonvanishing diﬀeomorphisminvariant tensor ﬁelds this shows  ψgµνψ   for all physical states analogousarguments can be made for spontaneous symmetry breaking in ordinary gauge theoryhowever in that case one can argue that even though the local symmetry is not spontaneously broken the corresponding global symmetry is it may be possible to extend thisargument to gravity with asymptotically ﬂat boundary conditions but it certainly cannotapply to closed universes where there is no way to disentangle local and global diﬀeomorphisms what is the appropriate gauge invariant operator which captures the notion ofnondegenerate metrics newer variablesalthough the constraints  are considerably simpler than the usual form in terms ofthe old canonical variables it is reasonable to ask whether this is the best one can do doesthere exist an even more clever choice of variables which will lead to further simpliﬁcationsas we have discussed one of the constraints in ashtekar variables is quadratic in momentaand must be regulated are there canonical variables for which all constraints are linear inmomenta to see that ones choice of variables can in principle change the structure of theconstraints in this way consider again three dimensional general relativity in terms of thestandard canonical variables the spatial metric and extrinsic curvature the constraintsare very similar to the four dimensional case in particular they are quadratic in momentaand nonpolynomial in the spatial metric however in gauge theory variables althoughthe constraints are quadratic in the connection they are linear in the triad which is itsconjugate momentum thus there is a natural representation in which all constraints arelinear in momentumcomparing the actions for general relativity in three  and four  dimensions thereare two obvious diﬀerences the group is changed from so to so and there isan extra eaµ in the action one can actually separate these two eﬀects there are threedimensional theories which generalize  to any gauge group including so let a bethe gauge ﬁeld for an arbitrary lie group f  da + a  a the ﬁeld strength and e be alie algebra valued one form then one can consider the actions  z t r e  fthe constraints are identical to  and  with r replaced by f in particular theyare linear in the momentum conjugate to ai in four dimensions there are theories withactions similar to  for any gauge groups  z t rcide e  fcidwhere e is again a lie algebra valued one form for the case of so the canonicalquantization of this theory has been carried out unlike the three dimensional examplesthis theory has an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom nevertheless once again allconstraints are linear in momentumas a ﬁnal example consider supergravity in this theory the scalar constraint can infact be replaced by its square root  the supersymmetry constraints since the originalconstraint is quadratic in momentum one might hope that the supersymmetry constraintswould be at most linear in the momentum unfortunately this is not the case althoughthe supersymmetry constraints are linear in the momentum conjugate to the metric theycontain a term which is the product of the momentum conjugate to the metric and themomentum conjugate to the spin  ﬁeld  this is again the product of functionalderivatives at the same point and must be regulated in retrospect it is clear that thesupersymmetry constraints cannot be linear in all momenta the anti commutator oftwo constraints linear in momenta is always linear in momenta and cannot yield the scalarconstraint of general relativityit is perhaps worth mentioning that going to higher dimensions does not seem veryin higher dimensions general relativity can still be expressed in terms of apromisinglorentz connection ωabµ and collection of one forms eaµ with the actions  z ea      eb  rcd ǫabcdhowever there is no obvious analog of using the selfdual part of the connection thus it isnot even clear how to mimic the simpliﬁcation obtained by ashtekar ashtekars variablesdo not have a natural generalization to higher dimensionsin conclusion i would say that i ﬁnd the general ideas of ashtekars approach toquantum

renormalization for all ﬁeldsin the theory stating it diﬀerently we could expect that renormalized ﬁelds φk wouldbe again powers of some basic ﬁeld φindeed it is not entirely clear what the precise statement of nonrenormalizationis for instance there always exist local coordinates near a ﬁxed point in which the βfunction is linear  moreover any statement about the form of the β function canbe changed by redeﬁnition of couplings such coordinates are usually singular theyare essentially the bare coordinates and put all nontrivial ﬁxed points at coordinateinﬁnity  although they might be a ﬁnite physical distance in the zamolodchikovmetricin any case for our situation the result of  indicates that there are nonearby ﬁxed points one might say that nonrenormalization is the statement

thediscrepancy between our ihh  π and his result ihhl  h  πǫ is quite substantial and so deserves a full comment the four point functions we integrate areidentical however obtained by diﬀerent methods as can be easily checked so thesource of the diﬀerence lies in the method of integration the problem is caused bythe expansion of the fǫ ǫ ǫ z and f  ǫ   ǫ   ǫ z hypergeometricfunctions of in general any function with the parameters fα α + m γ zwhere m is natural number will have a very nonuniform expansion  and additionally when α + m  γ there will be also a logarithmic divergence at z   consequently for the above set of parameters the hypergeometric function containsthe inﬁnite series of logarithms  and the approximation of f functions for smallǫ which we believe was made in the  is not valid neglecting the fact of highlyununiform behaviour of this type of hypergeometric functions would probably alwayslead to the wrong answer analytic continuation of the complete d integrals

may byitself be a very fruitful idea thirdly it has also been shown that w+ algebra generates the wn constraintsfor the n matrix model solutions for nonperturbative d quantum gravity coupled to a matter system withc    and has been further argued to be the underlying symmetry for these systems various freeﬁeld realisations for w  w+  and superw  have been found these realisations provide a more transparent way to investigate issues concerning these algebras and their applicationsfor example in ref  the freefermion realisation of w at c   has played a pivotal rˆole in carryingout the reduction to wn from w in ref  the w+ constraints were obtained from a singlescalarrealisation that is the bosonised form of the complex fermion realisation of w+ in ref  realisations of w provided the matter system in which framework the gauging of w symmetries have beencarried outthere exists a common feature among the various complex freeﬁeld realisations of w namely thecurrents for these

realisations of w and w+ are diﬀerent in that they are nonlinear realisations obtained fromthe bosonisation of the corresponding fermion realisation since one can bosonise complex bosons as well ascomplex fermions it must be possible to achieve other nonlinear realisations by bosonising the complexbosonrealisation of w this is precisely what we will accomplish in this paperwe shall ﬁrst review various realisations of the w algebras in the literature and illustrate theirinterrelationships we then proceed to carry out the bosonisation of the complexboson realisations of thew algebras by the wellknown procedure of ref  the bosonised currents are expressed in terms ofa pair of fermions and a scalar bosonising the fermions further we obtain a realisation of w in terms oftwo coupled

one can also perform the same procedure to the case of w to extract a realisation of w in factsince the rotation of basis needed for leaving out the spin current in w+ amounts to lower order termsonly

realisation of the w algebras we have foundnonlinear realisations of w in terms of a scalar ﬁeld and a pair of fermions the couplings between thescalar and the fermions are rather subtle and crucial for the closure we have also shown that by bosonisingthe fermions further and keeping the most nonlinear terms only the classical limits of w can be achievedwe explicitly demonstrate the closure of these limits namely w and w+ in the classical sensegiven the fact that the classical w has been realised in terms of two scalars ρ and σ it would beinteresting to ﬁnd certain group theoretic structure for them ie to view ρ and σ as components of certainmultiplet as the examples in ref it is also worth noting that the twoscalar realisation of w can be used as a matter system coupledto w gravity whose quantisation presumably deforms the symmetry structure to quantum w analogousto the quantisation of single scalar coupled to w gravity  the resulting theory of two scalar ﬁeldscorresponds to the complex scalar ϕ coupled to w gravity given in it has been observed  that the singlescalar realisation of w at c   can be viewed as a realisationof w or wn under appropriate normal ordering procedure

    "text": "introductionstring theory  is a prime candidate for a uniﬁed quantum description of shortdistance physics which naturally gives rise to spacetime gravity as well as gauge ﬁeldsand matter however our understanding of this theory is hindered by its complexityrelated to the enormous number of spacetime degrees of freedom massive resonances theproliferation of vacua and lack of an organizing nonperturbative dynamical principlein this situation one is motivated to look for toy models which capture some of theimportant properties of strings while allowing for a more complete understandinginthe last year important progress was made in treating such toy models corresponding tostrings propagating in a two dimensional d spacetime the low spacetime dimensiondrastically reduces the number of degrees of freedom eliminating most of the massiveoscillation modes of the string and leaving behind essentially only the center of mass ofthe string the tachyon ﬁeld as a physical ﬁeld theoretic degree of freedom followingthe seminal work of    it was understood that the center of mass in these d stringtheories is described by free fermion quantum mechanics     this remarkablephenomenon has led to rapid progress in the qualitative and quantitative understandingof these theories    this progress was phrased in the language of matrix models of random surfaces it is important to understand the results and in particular the free fermion structure in themore familiar polyakov path integral formulation of d gravity  if we are to utilizethe impressive results of d string theory in more physically interesting situations whichare either hard to describe by means of matrix models eg fermionic string theories orcan be described by matrix models which are hard to solve eg d   string theorieswe must learn how to handle the continuum liouville theory more eﬃciently despiteimportant progress in this direction     some aspects of the matrix modelresults are still mysteriousthe purpose of this paper is to try and probe the continuum string theory in variousways with the hope of understanding the underlying free fermion structure we will notbe able to get as far as that but we will see aspects of the simplicity emerging most of ouranalysis will be done on the sphere the matrix model techniques are so far much morepowerful in obtaining higher genus results as a compensation the spherical structure willbe quite well understood in fact many of the results described below were not obtainedfrom matrix models so farwhat can we hope to learn from such an endeavour the free fermion structure ofd string theory is highly unlikely to survive in more physically interesting situationshowever there are some features which are expected to survive the g growth of theperturbation expansion is expected  to be a generic property of all super stringtheories issues related to background independence of the string ﬁeld theory the formof the classical non linear equations of motion in string ﬁeld theory and even the rightvariables in terms of which one should formulate the theory may be studied in this simplercontext the advantage of such a simple solvable framework is to provide a laboratory toquantitatively check ideas in string ﬁeld theory the fact that we do not quite understandthe matrix model results from the continuum is signiﬁcant it suggests that a new point ofview on the existing techniques or new techniques are needed for treating strings finallyit was argued recently  that one can study spacetime singularities in string theoryusing related two dimensional string models issues related to gravitational back reactioncan be naturally described and studied in the continuum approachthe paper is organized as follows in section  after

are led to study minimal or c   matter with action sm g on a riemann surfacewith metric g coupled to the liouville mode the action is s  slˆg + sm ˆgwhere the dynamical metric is gab  eφˆgab andslˆg scattering processes since such bulk amplitudes are insensitive to the precise form of thewall as well explicitly see later they can be calculated using free ﬁeld techniques thisis the ﬁrst step which is performed in section the results for bulk amplitudes are puzzling if one compares them with the well knownstructures arising in critical string theory there bulk scattering is the only eﬀect presentand it is described by a highly nontrivial s  matrix incorporating duality an inﬁnitenumber of massive resonances etc the main diﬀerences between this situation and oursare the critical string amplitudes are meromorphic in the external momenta when theintegral representation diverges one calculates the amplitudes by analytic continuationwe will see that in d string theory the situation is more involved this is expected to bea general property of all d   non critical string theories the bulk scattering amplitudes in the d problem exhibit miraculous symmetries ﬁrstnoticed in  most of the tachyon scattering amplitudes vanish those which do nothave an extremely simple form which is strongly reminiscent of the corresponding freefermion expressions   these phenomena are far from completely understood andhave to do on the one hand with the small number of states and large symmetry in thetheory and on the other with peculiarities of massless d kinematics for all d   theform of the amplitudes is qualitatively similar to that in the critical case d   hencean abrupt change in the behavior of the theory occurs between d   and d  at the second stage after treating tachyon scattering in the bulk we proceed andconsider the generic scattering amplitudes which probe the structure of the liouville walla direct approach seems unfeasible and we argue instead that one can deduce the generalstructure of the interactions from their bulk part the main idea is that the liouville interaction  represents in target space language a tachyon condensate if we understandthe interaction of tachyons in the bulk it is reasonable to expect that we can understandthe dynamical eﬀect of the wall this procedure is nevertheless not guaranteed to workapriori but it does here in d and this allows us to obtain the full tree level tachyonscattering matrix the most remarkable feature of this s  matrix is that one can writedown all n point functions explicitly scattering amplitudes are naturally expressed interms of target space feynman rules with an inﬁnite number of calculable irreducible nparticle interactions which can be thought of as arising from integrating out the massivediscrete modes one of the main technical results of this section is the evaluation ofthese irreducible vertices we also discuss the spacetime picture which emerges from thistreatment of the tachyon and apply the results to calculations of correlation functions inminimal models  coupled to gravity reproducing the results of the kdv formalism in section  we apply the techniques of section  to the problem of calculating correlation functions in fermionic string theory again in d as expected from general arguments there is little qualitative diﬀerence between this case and the simpler bosonic onethe only ﬁeld theoretic degree of freedom in the neveuschwarz ns sector is again themassless tachyon the center of mass of the string the ramond r sector contains anadditional massless bosonic spacetime ﬁeld we ﬁnd that the massless sector scatteringpicture in fermionic d string theory is similar to the one obtained in the bosonic casethe only diﬀerence is in the spectrum of discrete states in the two models the way itaﬀects the scattering illuminates the role of the latter we mention the possibility  ofobtaining stable tachyon free superstring theories at d   by a chiral gso projectionof the fermionic string and show that the d superstring is topologicalsection  contains some comments on the physics of discrete massive states in dstring theory those are important from several points of view first they representthe only remnants of the inﬁnite tower of massive states  the hallmark of string theory and it would be interesting to study their dynamics second these discrete operatorsare instrumental to the question of gravitational back reaction in two dimensional stringtheory   and by understanding their dynamics we may study issues related togravitational singularities in string theory finally they are closely related to the largesymmetry of d string theorysection  contains some summarizing remarks in appendices ab we compare liouville results with those of matrix models given by generalized kdv equations  forminimal models and describe some features of the pi tachyon amplitudes tachyon dynamics in bosonic string theory the general structure and strategywe will concentrate throughout this paper on the situation in string theory in twodimensional space time where many special features arise it will be very useful to have inmind the perspective of the higher dimensional situation for comparison we will describeit in this subsection in addition to deﬁning some concepts which will be useful later anddescribing the procedure which we will use to calculate the s  matrixthus we start with the polyakov string in ﬂat d dimensional euclidean spacesm x g is merely the lowest lying state of the inﬁnite string spectrum and because it is tachyonicthus absent in more physical theories our justiﬁcation will come later when well considerthe two dimensional situation where the tachyon is the only ﬁeld theoretic degree offreedom and is massless we will still call it tachyon then the on shell form of thetachyon vertex operator istk  expik  x + βkφwhere k x are d  vectors and brst invariance implieseuclidean d momentum it is well known that one can at best make sense of theorieswith tachyons on the sphere at higher genus on shell tachyons in the loops cause irdivergences the existence of such states in a string theory is in one to one correspondencewith existence of a non trivial number of states   the cosmological operator in corresponds to a macroscopic state for d   the main object of interest to us here will be the tachyon s  matrix the set ofamplitudeswhere the average is performed with the action  translational invariance in x impliesak kn   htk tknimomentum conservationki  nxithere is no momentum conservation in the φ direction due to the interaction therefore ingeneral all amplitudes  satisfying  are non vanishing the liouville path integralis complicated but some preliminary intuition can be gained by integrating out the zeromode of φ φ  splitting φ  φ + φ where r φ   and integrating in  r we ﬁndak  kn cid µdφwith s   receive their main contribution from the vicinity of the wall as s   we seean apparent divergence in  more generally this happens whenever s  z+ fromthe world sheet point of view this is a trivial eﬀect the laplace transformed amplitude isﬁnite everywhereµsγs z daas expµafrom  we see that the s   divergence at ﬁxed µ is a small area divergence in theintegral over areas a from this point of view the right way to interpret  for s  z+ isto replace µsγs  µsthe kinematics allows a ﬁnite region in momentum space where the integral representation converges which is usually not the case for masslessmassive particles it is nicethat such a region exists since unlike critical string theory the amplitudes here can not becontinued analytically they do not deﬁne meromorphic functions of the momenta becauseof non conservation of liouville momentum energy associated with the existence of theexponential wall more importantly we will be able to actually calculate the integrals in the above kinematic region and ﬁnd simple results this will imply that theback reaction is much simpler and milder in two dimensions than in general and willallow us to recover the full dynamical eﬀect of the liouville wallstep  the program described above can not be carried out for d   we can understandthe nature of the diﬃculties and gain additional intuition by studying the s   four pointfunction of tachyons which can be calculated for all d as in the critical string case thus we consider ask  k which is given using   byask  k  πγk  ki  ββi + yiand turning on the other modes  this is standard in string theory well see later thatwhile the form  is still correct for d   the physical picture is quite diﬀerentfor more than four particles the s   amplitude  is given by the usual shapiro virasoro integral representation ask  kn nyizikkiββi  zikkiββinyijzi  zjkikjβiβj  no closed expression for  is known in general the basic problem in evaluatingit is the complicated pole structure of ak  kn there are many channels in whichpoles appear to analyze them quantitatively one has to consider the region of the moduliintegrals in  where some number of zi approach each other for example to analyzethe limit z z  zn+   it is convenient to redeﬁnez  ǫ z  ǫy  zn+  ǫyn+and consider the contribution of the region ǫ   to  by simple algebra weﬁnd an inﬁnite number of poles at e  q two dimensional string theory and minimal models d   matter theoriesin the rest of the section well be mainly interested in the theory  with d d +    which consists of two scalar ﬁelds φ x   x it will be convenient to generalizeslightly by introducing a background charge for xsm momentum conservation impliesnki + md + nd+  αxialthough the structure for rational α is much richer than the generic one it is easier tocalculate correlators including screening at irrational α and to analytically continue themto rational α see  for details furthermore we will ﬁnd it convenient to considergeneric ks not only those corresponding to degenerate representations in the applicationto c   we are interested in correlators with n m   and generic k at the end of thecalculation we should take α  what is the space time picture corresponding to string theory with matter given by the action  takes in this case the forms sα+ + k  α + k  α + k  α q we seem to ﬁnd diﬀerent results for the two signs of α but from   it isclear that physics must be independent of this sign the α   c   limit is singular since ρ  the resolution of these puzzles is quite instructive we will see later that  is thegeneral tachyon three point function then it is clear that if nothing special happens forinteger s  n we should have ak k k  µnf k k k with some ﬁnite f  but thisis equivalent to a vanishing ﬁxed area amplitude see  in order to have a non zeroﬁxed area amplitude at s  z+ fsnk k k must diverge the only diﬀerence betweenpositive and negative α is that for α   all factors in  are ﬁnite for generic kswhile for α   m  s supplies the necessary divergence eq  is anexample of a general phenomenon we will see later that all bulk amplitudes vanish exceptthose for which all ki  α except one have the same sign since we chose k k  αk  α and the s punctures in  correspond to k  α   when α   and viceversa  is the natural result we see that the apparent discrepancy between positiveand negative α in  is due to the fact that we impose a resonance condition whichis discontinuous of course although both signs of α are right it is more useful toconsider α   this is what well do belowthe foregoing discussion seems to be at odds with our previous comments we haveargued that if the integral representation  diverges we can not continue analyticallybecause of the expected appearance of cuts in amplitudes but of course for α   theintegral representation is always divergent the simplest way to see that is to note thatthe integrand in  is positive deﬁnite while the integral  is  shouldnt we thendiscard the results in this casea useful analogy is critical string tree level scattering in that case there is no rangeof momenta where the integral representation converges for masslessmassive particlessince the integral representations for the diﬀerent channels s t u for n   converge indiﬀerent non overlapping kinematic regions while the string world sheet integral includesall channels in that case one splits the world sheet integral into several parts calculatesthem at diﬀerent momenta and analytically continues using the space time picture as aguide to compute the divergent world sheet integral here we do the same thats why onecan trust the divergent integral  for α   liouville momentum is conserved forbulk amplitudes the key assumption is that there is a consistent space time interpretationso far we have considered the ﬁrst puzzle mentioned above what happens as we takec   from  we learn that the operator expα+φ  exp qdecouples in this case notice that its wave function ψ  is constant thus not peakedat φ   and does not correspond to a local operator its decoupling is consistent with  however there is another brst invariant operator φ exp qcan calculate them in the bulk we would like to argue that this fact is an indicationthat tachyon dynamics can be described by an eﬀective local two dimensional ﬁeld theoryobtained by integrating out the massive modes this is not usually the case in stringtheory beyond low energy approximations the light string states can not be describedeven classically by a local action tachyon amplitudes eg contain poles correspondingto all the massive modes of the string  if we integrate out the latter we ﬁnd a highlynon local action in two dimensions the situation is better the tachyon is the only ﬁeldtheoretic degree of freedom it interacts with an inﬁnite set of massive quantum mechanicaldegrees of freedom which exist only at particular discrete momenta this interactionis summarized by the normalization factors mi in  space time gravity and ingeneral inclusion of the discrete states seems to have the mild eﬀect of renormalizing thetachyon ﬁeld the renormalized tachyon t is described by a d ﬁeld theory the fact thatits bulk three point function  is one and more generally that the bulk correlationfunctions obtained below are polynomial in momenta is compatible with this suggestionthus we are led to postulate that all correlators of t must be polynomial in externalmomenta this will allow us to ﬁx them uniquely eg for the three point function weconclude that  is the general result for all s since the only polynomial p ki whichis  whenever s  z+ is p ki  to recapitulate two dimensional string theory has the striking property that it isdescribed by two consistent s  matrices the one familiar from critical string theory isthat for tk   it has poles corresponding to all on shell string states and is crucialfor the issue of the role of space time gravity in the theory we will return to it in section however in two dimensions the role of space time gravity is mild the renormalized ﬁeldt is described by a second s  matrix which follows from a two dimensional ﬁeld theoryaction in fact the action giving the set of t amplitudes is known from the matrix modelapproach    in the rest of this section we will describe in detail this s  matrixit is important to emphasize that despite the simple relation  the two s  matricesdescribe genuinely diﬀerent physics for example the t s  matrix does not have bulkscattering unlike that of t  in fact there is nothing special about amplitudes with s  at all in this picture more importantly gravitational physics is absent in t  the newfeature in two dimensional string theory is that we seem to be able to turn oﬀ space timegravitythe third step in the general program of section  involving the extension of to regions in ki where the integral representation diverges is trivial here  we do not expectanything non trivial since the full eﬀect of liouville momentum non conservation is not feltin three point functions it is nevertheless instructive to examine the region of convergenceof  to make contact with the discussion of section  from integrability as wi   in  we ﬁnd α +    β +    in terms of the liouville momenta and introducingα  α+ such that q  α+ + α and for α   α  α  α+  this implies arestriction on the energiesβki αfor rational α+ for which s  is in general non integer as before we will ﬁrst tuneki α+ such that s is integer and calculateamnk k k  πµand a certain z selection rule of course this can not be the whole story since is not symmetric under permutations of    even if we symmetrize it seems that wehave lost the truncation of the fusion rules  r + r + r  p  s + s + s  p  this is of course not the case the issue is the correct treatment of the ﬂat space amplitudesthe usual way one gets the three point couplings there is by factorization of four pointfunctions  it is known that the direct evaluation of the feigin fuchs integrals for thethree point function  does not yield the same results rather one has to symmetrizeby using the symmetry of ﬂipping any two of the three vertices vrs  vprps this symmetry must be manifest in all n point functions and by construction also aftercoupling to gravity thus we have to apply this symmetry to  the result is h trstrstrsi  µsnrsrsrswhere nrisi    are the ﬂat space fusion numbers eq  is compatible withmatrix model results  and generalizes them considerably similar results for a subsetof three point functions were obtained in  n   point functionsin the previous subsections we have obtained the three point function of the tachyonﬁeld remarkably in two dimensional string theory one can calculate all n point functionsthe miraculous cancellations encountered above will be seen here to be due to an interestingstructure of

continuation of  to all momenta our next task is to understand thegeneral structure of the correlators by deriving constraints which liouville theory placeson the form of this space time ﬁeld theory

us to calculate ap i we writeak  k  when the integral representations diverge they are deﬁned in a diﬀerent way in the twocases however we see that both situations are described by essentially the same twodimensional ﬁeld theory in space time another curious feature of the c   α   models is that the screening chargesin  are not treated on the same footing as the tachyon despite the fact thatvdthey are naively tachyon vertices of momenta d to see that one can compare the threepoint functions with screenings to the n point functions without screenings for examplecomparing  with n   m   to the four point function  with one of themomenta equal to d+ we ﬁnd that in general the two diﬀer again this is consistentsince the screening charges lie outside of the region of convergence of the integral representation  however the full implications of this observation are unclear to us thesecomplications are also the reason why n   point functions with screening are harder toobtainit is now clear how to proceed in the case of n point functions we assume that weknow already alegs propagator  αp i anp i then we write all possible tree graphs with n externalregion it is important that the

whose vertex operator can be constructed using  first we bosonize thefermions ψx ψ asψ  the massless s  matrixmost of the features of the discussion of the wave function  the φ zero mode integration  and its space time interpretation can be borrowed for the supersymmetriccase the only modiﬁcation of  needed is replacing bosonic correlators by fermionicones replacing ﬁelds by superﬁelds   moduli by supermoduli etc as well asadding the new r r ﬁeld v  since as explained above we are forced to analyticallycontinue in momenta in order to ignore contact terms we concentrate below on the cases   in  which is in any case the most general bulk amplitude in the next twosubsections we ﬁrst consider the s  matrix of the tachyon t and then that of the ramondﬁeld v  tachyon scattering in fermionic d

zero at mi   occurs at β   q and we can proceed recursively as in the bosonic case or use a symmetry argumentrelating vanishing of t  m  l to that of t  m  l +  see discussion after therefore f  is an entire function of mi one can also show in complete parallelwith the bosonic case that f is bounded as  m   say to do this we redeﬁnezi  eξiwe ﬁnd that tk scattering is described by the same s  matrix as that of the bosonictachyon  some examplesh tktkh tktktktki tki   αk + k  α + k + k  α + k + k  α correct mi   are used one has to remember that in fermionic string theoryin addition to the trivial

ramond scattering has the following interesting featurethe zero energy k  α states  do not decouple unlike the case of the tachyon despite the fact that their wave function  is not peaked at φ   we saw in section see discussion following eq  that one way to understand the decoupling of the zeroenergy tachyon is kpz scaling at k  α there is an additional brst invariant tachyonstate φ exp qshow that it is bounded as  mi   hence it is independent of the  mi to determinef we use space time arguments as for the tachyon kpz scaling  allows us to readoﬀ the propagator for the ramond ﬁeld αk  α and consequently the two pointfunction hvkvαki  iz is a holomorphic operator  i   note that it is brst invariant  we nowproject out all operators   etc which do not have a local ope with iz this removes some states from the existing ns ns r r hilbert spaces by actingon the remaining states with iz we generate two new sectors r ns and ns rwhich contain space time fermions geometrically the

operators with k   we are leftwith the operatorstn  expσ + in +are generic and kn   vanish here we will sketch the proof of this statement it is infact more convenient to prove vanishing of correlators containing any number of v  andtachyons of generic momenta in a recent paper  it was shown that the c   matrix model possesses a largesymmetry algebra closely related to the discrete states vrr  here on the other hand wehave seen that the simplicity of the amplitudes is directly due to the decoupling of v rrthe two observations should be related a symmetry would explain eg why decouplingof all v rr is implied by that of v r  v r tachyons at special momentaas explained in section  the poles that do appear in the ﬁnal answer for the npoint functions correspond to intermediate states in the i n  channel we can nowcheck which of the states v +rr  appear in this channel straightforward algebraleads to the conclusion that the pole of γmi  at mi  r corresponds to theintermediate state v +rrn thus for given n we see in intermediate channels allstates with m  rn   as noted in section  as we vary n  we ﬁnd contributionsof all physical states the reason why only intermediate states with ﬁxed r appear forﬁxed n is actually purely kinematical htk tkm v +rri with all ki   which arise asresidues of poles in  see  can only be non zero if r  m   by momentumconservation and the resonance conditionwe see that the bulk s  matrix for the tachyon ﬁeld describes reasonable spacetime physics the massless scalar tachyon ﬁeld couples to an inﬁnite set of massivehigher spin ﬁelds which are essentially pure gauge except at particular momenta thegauge symmetry of string theory corresponding to decoupling of brst commutators isresponsible for the restriction of the on shell massive ﬁelds to discrete momenta howeverthe simplicity of the results   is due in addition to decoupling of half of theremaining states v simpliﬁcation in the dynamics and in particular is responsible for the fact that the polesin the s  matrix occur as a function of external momenta alone the solvability of therr which is not explained by these symmetries this implies a furthermatrix model is probably closely related to this phenomenon one of the most interestingremaining problems is the realization and implications of this new symmtery on the spacetime equations of motion in two dimensional string theory it appears that the discretemomenta must play a special role in the space time action there are several propertiesof the results which point to this all essentially related to the decoupling of v rr whichwe emphasize is not automatically related to the fact that by gauge invariance massivephysical states occur only at the above discrete momentain particular applying thelogic of  to our situation it seems that a tachyon background tk  which satisﬁesthe linearized equations of motion of the string is marginal also solves the exact nonlinear equations of motion is truly marginal as long as another inequivalent way to deﬁne correlation functions of v +rr is to follow thecritical string logic we illustrate this procedure with the example of v +  x x thelog µ divergence discussed above is due in this case to the fact that turning on x xshifts the dimensions of the exponentials tk and we have to compensate by adjustingthe momenta ki then inserting x x into a correlation function  corresponds topi ki there are extensions and applications of our results which may be interestinga it is important to derive our results for the extension from the bulk to the boundarycorrelation functions which we got by using space time arguments directly from the worldsheet liouville theory this should shed some light on the origin of the local action for thetachyon ﬁeldb we have restricted our attention to genus zero tree level amplitudes from matrixmodels   we know that the results for higher genus are almost as simple and itwould be nice to understand them too from the continuum we would like to point outin this context that one may have problems of convergence of the appropriate integralrepresentations which are again trivial generalizations of the  dimensional ones  thesum rule pi mi    for s   is replaced for genus h bynximi    hand since one still expects divergences when mi   there is probably no region where theintegral representation converges the space time picture should be useful here as in thespherical case and we expect a similar analysis to give the results of c it would be interesting to see what properties survive in more realistic string theoriesthe natural candidates to consider are the non critical superstrings  where one canincrease the number of degrees of freedom in a controlled way without losing stability ofthe vacuum we have seen that in two dimensions the theory of  is topological itsproperties should be elucidated further one may study the related heterotic theorieswhich are probably topological as well they comprise a large class of theories which areprobably completely solvabled we saw that the d fermionic string is described in space time by a ﬁeld theory with twobosonic ﬁelds whose tree level s  matrix is exactly known one approach to calculatehigher genus corrections would be to try to write a space time theory similar to the dasjevicki one  now with two ﬁelds hopefully the tree level structure which we have foundexplicitly will determine it uniquely then one can use this action in the standard way to get all order results this should among other things shed light on e we have treated here two dimensional strings with n    susy for n   twodimensional string theory is critical and has been recently shown to possess some interesting features  we saw that the cases n    give similar space time physics andare closely related to the c   matrix model the situation is reminiscent of the relationbetween the n     minimal models of   in ﬂat space using our techniquesit is easy to show that all n   point functions in critical n   string theory vanishin agreement with  the reason is that as emphasized in  the theory is really fourdimensional but there is again only one ﬁeld theoretic degree of freedom unlike then    cases here the four dimensional kinematics implies vanishing of the amplitudesit would be interesting to understand the connection between the work of  and thetheories described here one interesting application is to the two dimensional black hole of  to understand that we have  to replace the cosmological term tk by v   first it is clearthat all bulk amplitudes s   of tachyons are the same as in the black hole solution of and the usual c   case considered in this paper also we saw that bulk amplitudescontaining tachyons of generic k and v  vanish we see again that to solve the blackhole theory we must understand the dynamics of the discrete states v +rr since only theycouple to v  the resulting picture of

the correct parity one needs tostart with the letter super hierarchyit precisely leads to the accomplishment of anexplict constrction of the ﬁrst super kp hamiltonian structure  which is indeeda supersymmetric extension of the ﬁrst ordinary kp hamiltonian structure  thereduction of this super kp hierarchy gives rise to all the generalized nth even superkdv hierarchies which have been shown to be bihamiltonian  thus it remains toexplore the bihamiltonian structure of the super kp hierarchyof physical interests the kp hierarchy via its hamiltonian structures is known toincorporate all known extended conformal w algebras in particular the second hamiltonian structure of the nth kdv hierarchy was found  to be identical to the wnalgebra  and then the ﬁrst hamiltonian structure of the kp hierarchy itself wasshown  to generate the w+ and w algebras  that are the general linear deformations of wn in the usual large nlimit  further the second kp hamiltonianstructure was suggested to be isomorphic to the unique nonlinear deformation of w the ˆw algebra  which is expected to constitute a universal w algebra containingall wn algebras through the natural reduction of kp to kdvs upon supersymmetrization the newly established ﬁrst super kp hamiltonian structure  naturally gives riseto a linear super w+ algebra whose bosonic sector is identiﬁed with w+  w+and a subalgebra of it turns out to be isomorphic to the known n   super w algebra similar to the ordinary case  one intends to obtain a universal super w algebraincorporating all known extended superconformal wn algebras by reduction and it isvery likely to be the general nonlinear deformation of super w which retains the characteristic nonlinearity of super wn  while there is evidence showing that super wnare related to the super kdv hierarchies  this universal super w algebra is stronglyexpected to be the yet to be determined second hamiltonian structure of the super kphierarchythe main issue of this paper is to obtain a oneparametric family of super hamiltonian forms based on the even operator  and identify the two limiting cases ofit as the ﬁrst  and second hamiltonian structures of the corresponding super kphierarchy we will present a comprehensive proof of this super bihamiltonian structurein a way similar to the ordinary kp case in addition we will construct a superbkp hierarchy by imposing a number of super antiselfdual constraints on super kpgeneralizing the ordinary bkp hierarchy it may provide another class of superw algebrassince both kp kdv hierarchy and its hamiltonian structures  w

    "text": "introductionthis paper is a continuation of ref  where we generalized the drinfeldsokolovconstruction of integrable hierarchies of partial diﬀerential equations from kacmoodyalgebras see  the work of drinfeld and sokolov itself constituted a generalization ofthe original kortewegde vries kdv hierarchy the archetypal integrable system themain omission from our previous paper was a discussion of the hamiltonian formalismof these integrable hierarchies which is the subject of this present paper a hamiltoniananalysis of these integrable systems allows a much deeper insight into their structurein particular important algebraic structures are encountered such as the gelfanddikiialgebras  or classical w algebras which arise as the second hamiltonian structure ofthe anhierarchies of drinfeld and sokolov though we shall say more about this laterthe exemplar of this connexion is found in the original kdv hierarchy whose secondhamiltonian structure is the virasoro algebra the new hierarchies of  lead amongstother things to the w ln algebras for   l  n   introduced in a feature often encountered in the hamiltonian analysis of integrable hierarchiesis the presence of two coordinated poisson structures which we designate φ ψ andφ ψ the property of coordination implies that the oneparameter family of bracketsφ ψ  φ ψ + µφ ψµ arbitrary is also a poisson structure which is a nontrivial statement as regards thejacobi identity we say a system has a bihamiltonian structure if the brackets arecoordinated and if the hamiltonian ﬂow can be written in two

drinfeldsokolov kdv hierarchies for the untwisted kacmoody algebrasthe fractional kdv hierarchy of ref  and various other cases reviewin this section we summarize certain salient aspects of ref  to which one shouldrefer for further detailsthe central object in the construction of the hierarchies is a kacmoody algebra ˆgrealized as the loop algebra ˆg  g  cz z  cd where g is a ﬁnite lie algebra thederivation d is chosen to induce the homogeneous gradation so that d azn  n azn a  g one can deﬁne other gradations as follows deﬁnition  a gradation of type s is deﬁned via the derivation ds which satisﬁesds ei  zn  nn + siei  znwhere ei i       rankg are the raising operators associated to the simple roots ofkisi where ki are the kac labels of gg in some cartanweyl basis of g n prankgiand s  s s     srankg is a vector of rankg +  nonnegative integerseach derivation can be expressed in the following wayds  n d + δs  hδs an important rˆole is played by the heisenberg subalgebras of ˆg which are maximalnilpotent subalgebras of ˆg see ref for a deﬁnition it is known that up to conjugation these are in onetoone correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the weylgroup of g  we denote these subalgebras as hw where w indicates the conjugacyclass of the weyl group of gremark for an element λ  hw the kacmoody algebra has the decompositionˆg  kerad λ  imad λin ref a distinction was made between hierarchiesof type i and type ii this referred to whether the element λ was regular  or not regularity implying that kerad λ  hw in what follows we shall restrict ourselvesto the former caseremark associated to each heisenberg subalgebra there is a distinguished gradationof type s which we denote sw with the property that hw is an invariant subspaceunder addsw one can introduce the notion of a partial ordering on the set of gradations of types we say s cid s if si   whenever si  lemma  an important property of this partial ordering is that if s cid s thenthe following is truei ˆgs  ˆgsii ˆgjs  ˆgs or ˆgs depending on whether j   or j   respectivelyiii ˆgjs  ˆgs or ˆgs depending on whether j   or j   respectivelyin the above we have used the notation ˆgas  iaˆgis and so on to indicatesubspaces of ˆgthe construction of the hierarchies relies on the matrix lax equation first of allassociated to the data λ s w one deﬁnes the objectl  x + q + λwhere λ is a constant element of hw with well deﬁned positive swgrade i byconstant we mean xλ   the fact that it is possible to choose λ to have a welldeﬁned swgrade follows from the second remark above the potential q is deﬁned tobe an element of crz q where q is the following subspace of ˆgq  ˆgs ˆgiswwhere s is any other gradation such that s cid sw the potentials are taken to beperiodic functions so as to avoid technical complications in this paper our interest is principally in the kdvtype hierarchies for which thegradation s is the homogeneous gradation for these systems the analysis of drinfeldand sokolov in ref generalizes leading to a bihamiltonian structure thus forbrevity we introduce the following notationsuperscripts will denote swgrades sothat ˆgj  ˆgjsw and subscripts will indicate homogeneous gradethe function qx plays the rˆole of the phase space coordinate in this system however there exist symmetries in the system corresponding to the gauge transformationl  slswith s being generated by

drinfeld and sokolov q consists of lowertriangular n +  by n +  dimensional matrices while the gauge group is generatedby strictly lower triangular matrices a good gauge slice and the choice made in

of commuting ﬂows on the gauge equivalence classes ofl these ﬂows have the following form for each element of the centre of kerad λwith positive swgrade which we denote by k there are two gauge equivalent ways ofwriting the ﬂowslthe quantities hj are the conserved densities for the ﬂows that is there exist quantities aj such thatthj + xaj  these conserved densities are in fact the hamiltonian densities for the hierarchies inref  it was shown that aj  constant for j   j  i and therefore the quantitieshj for i  j   are constant under all ﬂows in the hierarchy this is an importantobservation to which we return in section  the hamiltonian structuresin this section we explicitly construct the two coordinated hamiltonian structuresof the kdvtype hierarchies deﬁned by the requirement that s is the homogeneousgradation the ﬁrst hamiltonian structure is a direct generalization of the ﬁrst hamiltonian structure of the kdv hierarchy while the second involves a classical rmatrixour approach follows that of drinfeld and sokolov  preliminariesfor each b  hw there are four ways to write the ﬂowlthere is a natural inner product on the functions crz ˆg deﬁned as followsa b  zrzdx hax bxiˆgwhere h  iˆg is the killing form of ˆg explicitlyha  zn b  zmiˆg  ha bigδn+mwhere h  ig is the killing form of g with respect to an arbitrary gradation we canexpress the inner product in terms of the suitably normalized killing form of the ﬁnitelie algebra ˆgsa b xkzz dx hakx bkxiˆgswhere ak and bk are the components of a and b of grade k in the sgradation andh  iˆgs is the killing form of the ﬁnite lie algebra ˆgs the inner product does notdepend on the particular gradation chosen as long as the killing forms of the ﬁnitealgebras are suitably normalizedthe ﬁrst stage of the programme is to rewrite  and  in hamiltonian formin order to accomplish this components of ab have to be related to the hamiltoniansof the ﬂows which are in turn constructed from the conserved densities hjdeﬁnition  for a constant element b  hw we deﬁne the following functionalof qhbq  b hqwhere hq pji hj is the sum of the conserved densities of next we introduce the functional derivatives of functionals of qdeﬁnition  for a functional ϕ of q we deﬁne its functional derivative dqϕ crz ˆg viadobserve that the functional derivative dqϕ is valued in the subalgebra ˆg this isconnected to the choice of the space q  ˆg  ˆgi and is explained by a group theoretic formulation of the generalized kdv hierarchy which will be discussed in anotherpublicationsince r  crz q there is an ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the functionalderivative dqϕ corresponding to the fact that terms in the annihilator of q are not ﬁxedby the deﬁnition thus dqϕ is deﬁned up to terms in ˆgi the annihilator of q

 dqϕ dqψ l  dqϕ dqψ l where we have used the fact that dqϕ  dqϕ + dqϕ and that the inner productmatches terms of opposite grade in the following sections we discuss the rˆole of gaugesymmetry and whether these brackets deﬁne a symplectic structure gauge invarianceit has already been mentioned in section  that the hierarchies exhibit a gaugesymmetry more speciﬁcally the form of l is preserved under the transformationl  slsor equivalentlyq  q  sq + λs  λ + sxswhere s is an xdependent element of the group generated by the subalgebra p ˆg  ˆg for the kdvtype hierarchies considered in this section p is of maximumdimension for a given conjugacy class w as discussed in  the ﬂow equations ofthe hierarchy should be understood as equations on the gauge equivalence classes ofl under  for the generalized kdv hierarchy we have proposed two hamiltonian structures the fact that the hierarchies deﬁne dynamics on gauge equivalenceclasses implies that these hamiltonian structures should respect the gauge symmetryie that the poisson structure is well deﬁned on gauge invariant functionals howeverbefore proceeding with the discussion of gauge invariance it is necessary to prove thatthe brackets are actually well deﬁned as functionals of q ie that the ambiguity ofthe functional derivatives dqϕ and dqψ consisting of terms in crz gi do notcontribute to the bracket this is obtained as a corollary of the following lemmalemma  for ψ  crz ˆgiiiiiiicidψ z dqϕ lcid  ψ dqϕ l  ψ dqϕ l  proof the maximum swgrade of l is i and that of dqϕ is n   therefore themaximum swgrade of zdqϕ l is i   since ψ only has swgrade less than orequal to i the ﬁrst part of the lemma follows to prove the second part of the lemmawe notice that the maximum swgrade of dqϕ is  by lemma  therefore themaximum grade of the second term in the right side of the inner product is i  showing that the expression vanishes to show that the third expression vanishes ismore subtle and relies on the fact that the brackets are properly deﬁned on gaugeinvariant functionals a point that we shall come to shortly notice ﬁrst of all that theprojection ψ is the generator of an inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation the variationof q under this transformation is δεq  εψ l since ϕq is gauge invariant we haved proof consider the deﬁnition of the functional derivativedin order to demonstrate that the jacobi identity is satisﬁed we ﬁrst make thefollowing digression consider a lie algebra g with a lie bracket denoted    supposewe have an endomorphism r  end g then we can deﬁne a new bracket operationx yr  rx y + x ry

condition on rrx ry  rrx y + x ry  λx yfor some proportionality constant λ this equation is known as the modiﬁed yangbaxterequation mybe the simplest example of this procedure is when g has the vector

become apparent in our later analysis of thepartially modiﬁed kdv hierarchies  in section  for which the gradation s is chosento be more general than the homogeneous gradation hitherto considered centresin this section we point out that the poisson brackets deﬁned in theorem  sometimes admit nontrivial centres the existence of these centres is directly related to thehamiltonian densities hj with i  j   as we have already remarked these densitiesare constant under all the ﬂows of the hierarchy and so not all the functionals on m aredynamical we shall show below that the densities are

invariant functional and so the proposition is proved notice that the proof forthe second structure does not cover the case when f has zero swgradeit is an obvious corollary of the proposition that the densities hj for   j  i are directly it is interesting to notice that h isnondynamical as was proved in refnot a centre of the second poisson bracket algebra even though it is nondynamical apoint which will be apparent in the examples considered in section  conformal symmetryit is proved in  that the kdv hierarchies exhibit a scale invariance ie under thetransformation x  λx for constant λ each quantity in the equations can be assigneda scaling dimension such that the equations are invariant the original kdv equationprovides a typical example the appropriate transformations are x  λx u  λuand t  λt in this section we prove that this scaling invariance generalizes to thehierarchies deﬁned in  and are in fact symmetries of the second symplectic structureby generalizing this result to arbitrary conformal analytic transformations x  yxwe surmise that the second poisson bracket algebra contains as a subalgebra thealgebra of conformal transformations ie a virasoro algebra this would imply thatthe second poisson bracket algebra is an extended chiral conformal algebra generalizingthe occurrence of the w algebras as the second poisson bracket algebra of the hierarchiesof drinfeld

extends to the various partiallymodiﬁed hierarchies that are associated to a given kdv hierarchy these modiﬁedhierarchies are constructed by considering a lax operator of the form  whereq  crz qs qs  ˆgst ˆgi the space qs is a certain subspace of q labelledby another gradation of ˆg shom  s cid sw the fact that qs  q is a consequence oflemma  which implies that q  qs  ys where ys  ˆg  ˆgs the modiﬁed hierarchies have a gauge invariance of the form  where p is replaced by ps  ˆgs  ˆgthus the phase space denoted ms of a partially modiﬁed hierarchy consists of theequivalence classes of operators of the form  with q  crz qs modulo thegauge symmetry  generated by ps correspondingly the space of gauge invariantfunctionals on qs is denoted fs the unique hierarchy for which ps   ie s  swis the modiﬁed kdv hierarchy whereas the hierarchies for which s  sw are knownas partially modiﬁed kdv hierarchies it was shown in ref that all the partiallymodiﬁed hierarchies associated to a kdv hierarchy can be obtained as reductions ofthat kdv hierarchy here we shall prove this in a slightly diﬀerent way through ananalysis of the hamiltonian structurein attempting to extend the analysis of the previous sections to the partially modiﬁedkdv hierarchies we must separate the results that explicitly require the ﬁrst gradation sto be the homogeneous gradation an essential result in this direction is proposition which demonstrates that the second poisson bracket can be deﬁned without resortingto the homogeneous gradation from this result alone we can predict that the partiallymodiﬁed kdv hierarchies are hamiltonian with respect to the poisson bracketϕ ψs cidqs + λ dqsϕ dqsψrscid ciddqsϕ dqsψcid for ϕ and ψ  fs rs  ps  ps the hamiltonians being deﬁned identically tothat of deﬁnition  with the modiﬁcation that q  qs observe that the functionalderivatives are valued in ˆgscidˆgi this hamiltonian property of the pmkdv hierarchies can be veriﬁed directly the dynamical equations of the partially modiﬁed kdvhierarchies   being reproduced where subscripts now denote the gradations however we derive this result through the hamiltonian mapping properties of themiura maprecall that the phase space ms of a partially modiﬁed hierarchy consists of theequivalence classes of operators of the form  with q  crz qs modulo thegauge symmetry  generated by ps thus if we deﬁne imsq to denote the psgaugeorbit of q in qs the point of the phase space ms corresponding to q  crz qsis represented by the gauge orbit imsq given the inclusion qs  q there is acorresponding inclusion of equivalence classes ms  m where the equivalence classrepresented by imsq is mapped into the equivalence class represented by imhomq  qthis inclusion of equivalence classes is the miura map µ ms  m  observe thatthe gauge group p does not preserve the subspace qs ie the image imµ  qsimhomq the p gauge orbit of qs in q there is an inducedmapping µ f  fs given by restriction of the functionals to the submanifold ms inwhere imµ  sqqsparticular we have the following proposition relating the hamiltoniansproposition  the hamiltonians of the λ s wpartially modiﬁed hierarchy arethe restriction to ms of the hamiltonians of the associated λ shom wkdv hierarchyproof this follows from the observation that by restricting to the submanifold mswe can perform a gauge transformation such that q  crz qs in  thenφj  φjs  crz ˆgs  ˆgj ie φ is identical to the unique transformationemployed in the λ s whierarchy thus the restricted hamiltonians in deﬁnition are identical to the hamiltonians of the partially modiﬁed hierarchysince the hamiltonians of the partially modiﬁed hierarchy are reproduced on restriction the dynamical equations of the partially modiﬁed hierarchy will be reproduced ifthe hamiltonian structure restricts to ms ie if we deﬁne ims as the functionals thatvanish on ms  m then a hamiltonian structure is induced on fs  fcidims if ims isan ideal of the poisson bracket on m this is proved in the following propositionproposition  the second hamiltonian structure of the generalized kdv hierarchyinduces the following hamiltonian structure on ms ϕ ψs cidqs + λ dqsϕ dqsψrscid ciddqsϕ dqsψcid for ϕ and ψ  fs dqϕ  crz ˆgscidˆgi and rs  ps  psproof the idea of the proof is to verify that if we restrict to ms  m then thecorresponding operation on the functional derivatives ie taking the quotient is welldeﬁned as a lie algebra homomorphism the fact that the phase space consists ofgauge equivalence classes complicates this issue thus we proceed as follows considera functional ϕ  f  for q  imµ we can perform a gauge transformation such thatq  qs the remaining gauge freedom being ps with this partial gauge ﬁxing thederivative of ϕ with respect to the directions r  ys are not speciﬁed ie the functionalderivative is deﬁned up to annqs  ˆg  ˆgs mod ˆgi where anna  l b  l a   a  a for a a subalgebra of an algebra b expressing the secondpoisson bracket in terms of the sgradation proposition  we observe that annqsis an ideal of the centrally extended lie algebra ˆg   rs ωs thus the quotientis well deﬁned reproducing observe that this proves the prediction in  made on the strength of proposition the ﬁrst hamiltonian structure has not been mentioned in relation to the partiallymodiﬁed hierarchies this is because although the ﬁrst poisson bracket is well deﬁnedon the phase space ms it does not generate the dynamics ie equations   arenot reproduced from the hamiltonian mapping point of view this corresponds to thefact that the space annqs is not an ideal of the lie bracket    on ˆgcombining these results we obtain the following theoremtheorem  the miura map is a hamiltonian mappingµ ms   s  m    such that it deﬁnes a reduction of the dynamical equations of the kdv hierarchy to thoseof the pmkdv hierarchiesif we consider the decomposition q  qs + ˇqs where q  crz q qs proofcrz qs and ˇqs  crz ys then for a gauge equivalence class in ms themiura map is equivalent to the constraint ˇqs   the fact that the miura map ishamiltonian as follows from proposition  implies that this constraint is preservedunder all the ﬂows since the hamiltonians are reproduced on restriction to ms thetime evolutions of the pmkdv hierarchies  and  are reproduced under themiura mapwe should emphasize that the miura map µ  ms  m is not invertible it allowsone to construct a solution of the kdv hierarchy in terms of a solution of the partiallymodiﬁed hierarchy but not viceversa in addition one can show more generally thatthere exists a miura map between each partially modiﬁed hierarchy µ  ms  mswhenever s  s examples the drinfeldsokolov generalized kdv hierarchiesthe drinfeldsokolov kdv hierarchies  are recovered from our

the lowering operator associated to the highest root in thiscase q  b one of the borel subalgebras of g the gauge freedom corresponds to nwhere n is the subalgebra of g such that b  n + h as a vector space for examplein the case of an choosing the deﬁning representation we have  λ zand q consists of the lower triangular matrices including the diagonal in this examplethe gauge group is generated by the strictly lower triangular matriceswe can immediately write down the expression for the ﬁrst and second hamiltonianstructures if we deﬁne i pri ei and e  e to use the notation of  thenϕ ψ   dqϕ dqψ e since q has no z dependence andϕ ψ  dqϕ dqψ x + q + i these are exactly the two hamiltonian structures of the generalized kdv hierarchieswritten down in  for the untwisted kacmoody algebras we have not considered thecase of twisted kacmoody algebras here but it seems that in some cases only a singlehamiltonian structure exists see for a one ﬁnds that using the basis for f in  one recovers the explicit formof  the second poisson bracket algebras are the gelfanddikii algebras  whichare classical versions of the socalled w algebras of ref for the an case thescaling dimensions of the generators uj of  are n +   j where j       n andso the scaling dimensions range from  to n +  in integer steps in this case f has aunique element of dimension  namely un which generates the algebra of conformaltransformations or the virasoro algebra the a fractional kdvhierarchiesa series of hierarchies can be associated with any choice of w simply by choosingλ to be any element of hw with well deﬁned positive swgrade if we consider g  athen there are two elements in the weyl groupthe identity and the reﬂection in theroot the identity leads to a homogeneous hierarchy which is considered in section choosing w to be the reﬂection the heisenberg subalgebra is spanned by in thedeﬁning representation λm+  zm   zwhere m is an arbitrary integer and the superscript denotes the swgrade whenone takes λ to be the swgrade  element ie λ then the hierarchy which resultsis nothing but the usual kdv hierarchy discussed above when one takes λ to be anelement of the heisenberg subalgebra with grade   then we have what we mightcall a fractional hierarchy to mirror the terminology of  because the ﬁelds q havefractional scaling dimensionslet us consider these hierarchies in more detail if we take λ

corresponding to hk+ for k       m   in the center of thetwo poisson brackets rather than present a general result for the two hamiltonianstructures we just consider the ﬁrst two cases corresponding to i   and i   thecase i   is of course just the usual kdv hierarchy whose two poisson bracket algebrasare written down in the introductionthe case i  the case i   the first fractional a kdvhierarchy and w let us consider the kdv hierarchy corresponding to the coxeter element of the weylgroup but in contrast to the usual drinfeldsokolov case where λ is given by  wenow take λ to be the element of the heisenberg subalgebra with i   iez zλ this choice corresponds to the fractional kdv hierarchy discussed in  before gaugeﬁxing the potential can be written asq yecyda + bzf y + ywhich under a gauge

section  is only in the centre of the ﬁrstpoisson bracket and not the secondthe nonvanishing poisson brackets are the following for the ﬁrst hamiltonianstructure they areg+x gy  δx  yt x t y  xδx  ywhile for the second structure they areu x u y  the ﬁrst and second symplectic structures are easily calculated for the example tohand in the ﬁrst case one ﬁnds that the nonzero brackets areqαx qβy

centre of the second poisson bracket algebra an eventuality previously encounteredin proposition  nevertheless f is a constant under the ﬂows of the hierarchy becausethe hamiltonians satisfy the functional equationf x h  the virasoro generator in this case is constructed from the ﬁelds f and qα via thesugawara construction discussionwe have presented a systematic discussion of the hamiltonian structure of the hierarchies of integrable partial diﬀerential equations constructed in ref it was foundthat the analogues of the kdv hierarchies admit two distinct yet coordinated hamiltonian structures whereas the associated partially modiﬁed hierarchies only admit a singlehamiltonian structure generalizing the results of drinfeld and sokolov in additionwe found that the miura map between a modiﬁed hierarchy and its associated kdvhierarchy with the second hamiltonian structure is a hamiltonian map an aspect ofthe analysis that we have ignored is a thorough discussion of the restriction of the phasespace m to a symplectic leaf ie the rˆole of the centres this will be considered in alater publication where we propose a group theoretic description of these hierarchies interms of the akscoadjoint formulation of integrable systems ultimately it would bedesirable to understand the relation between the poisson brackets on the phase spacem presented here and the poisson brackets that exist on the akhiezerbaker functions if the analysis in  generalises to the continuum limit this would lead to aninterpretation of the dressing transformation in terms of a hamiltonian mapping connected with this we are also intrigued by the relation of our work to that of vg kacand m wakimoto  who following the philosophy of the japanese school constructa hierarchy associated to each of the basic level  representations of a kacmoodyalgebra and each conjugacy class of the weyl group of the underlying ﬁnite lie algebra these hierarchies are intimately connected to the vertex operator representationsof kacmoody algebras see  for further detailsnote that only the untwisted kacmoody algebras have been considered in thispaper it appears that the kdv hierarchies associated to twisted kacmoody algebrassometimes only admit a single hamiltonian structure see the second hamiltonian structure is invariant under an arbitrary conformal transformation these transformations include the scale transformations which reﬂect thequasihomogeneity of the equations of the hierarchy that is to say all quantities havewell deﬁned scaling dimensions such that a scale transformation leaves the equationsof motion invariant on general principles one would expect that the second poissonbracket algebra should contain the chiral algebra of conformal transformations as asubalgebra ie the virasoro algebra this would imply that the second poisson bracketalgebra is an extended chiral conformal algebra generalizing the appearance of thewn algebras in the work of drinfeld and sokolov  and gelfand and dikii  thiswas indeed found to be the case for the examples that were consideredof particular interest is the question as to whether these hierarchies have any rˆoleto play in the nonperturbative structure of two dimensional gravity coupled to mattersystems generalizing the known connexion of the drinfeldsokolov hierarchies it seemsthat one must supplement the hierarchy with an additional equation the socalled stringequation which has to be consistent with the ﬂows of the hierarchy then the potentialsof the hierarchy are apparently related to certain correlation functions of the ﬁeld

    "text": "introductionthere are now at least two proposals for a nonperturbatively stable formulationof two dimensional quantum gravity on the one hand there is the th timemethod rediscovered in the context of parisisourlas reduction of a one dimensional supersymmetric matrix model aka stochastic quantizationand on the other hand a deﬁnition following from nonperturbative kdvﬂows both proposals agree with the perturbative ie genus by genusresults from hermitian matrix models as indeed they must while also providingapparently a physically sensible nonperturbative extensionby physically sensible we mean at least that the string susceptibility andcorrelations of all local operators are real and free of singularities on the realaxis this has been shown to be true in the kdv ﬂow method and in thestochastic quantization method can be expected from the construction recall thatit is not true of the full nonperturbative result derived from hermitian matrixmodels  we also require that macroscopic loop expectation values bephysically sensible for the kdv ﬂow method this has been checked in refpart of the purpose of this paper will be to demonstrate similarly sensible resultsfor the stochastic quantization methodnaıvely one might expect that d quantum gravity has a unique nonperturbative extension and hence that the two proposals are equivalent thisis not the case we demonstrate this below both numerically and analytically itfollows unfortunately that at present the question of the correct nonperturbativeextension becomes a philosophical one the problem is of course that no generalprinciple of nonperturbative gravity has yet been deﬁned and since both methodshave the same perturbative expansionit is hard to promote one method overanother if they have no obvious ﬂawsthe proof that the kdv ﬂows are violated nonperturbatively in the stochasticquantization scheme will be as follows the kdv ﬂows induced by the operatorsok are given byρwe note in passing that it is in fact natural to introduce a new nonperturbativeparameter σ into  corresponding to the position of the eigenvalue spaceit corresponds physically to a worldsheet boundary cosmologicalboundaryconstant in this case  takes the form   ρ  σr  d hermitian matrix model potential that produces the same results is derived anumerical comparison of the onepoint function in both schemes is made in sect and in sect  we draw our conclusions the sphere for negative cosmological constantrecall that the stochastic quantization scheme for the simplest matrix modelswith cubic potentials results in replacing expectation values deﬁned in the hermitianmatrix model oφ here λr and λl denote the left and right turning points and ef denotes the fermienergy of the system ie the n th energy level scaled by n  the wkb conditionfor the n th energy level of the hamiltonian  is the equation  for the fermi energy can be written asn the solution of  is well known for µ   due to the inherent supersymmetryof the fphamiltonian  which is unbroken for µ   and is given byf +  for µ   it is readily seen that f expressed as elementary integrals numerical integration givesand zr      and zr   but the integrals can not bef   and zr   let us now turn to the observables of the theory the simplest and mostfundamental ones in the hermitian matrix model are the puncture operator and thesusceptibility in the case of the potential  the bare puncture operator andthe susceptibitity can be deﬁned as follows o  if we recall that g  gc  gcaµ the leading nonanalytic power of g  gc is given bythe term involving the fermi energy since it is diﬀerent from zero for both positiveand negative cosmological constants according to  and  we conclude thatthe  must be violated even at the spherical level by the stochastic regularizationif we integrate  with respect to g  gc we getλc o f p it is now clear that taking the limit a   before calculating expectation valuesmeans that we are breaking supersymmetry in a way identical to adding a sourceterm j since only the combination µ + j appears in  after a is zero of coursethe integrals deﬁning the expectation values will now be divergent since we havedropped the stabilizing term in the potential however if one just introduces acutoﬀ λ  a in the integrals it can be shown that the leading nonanalyticalbehaviour is still the same as with the full potential in this way one can convert to an equation similar to  where the diﬀerentiation is with respect toµ and where γf p µ is the energy calculated from the n fermion system with theunbounded potential µy + y but with a lower cutoﬀ λ  a all results inthis section can be derived using this technique macroscopic loops on the spheremotivated by ref we make some remarks on the expectation value of asingle macroscopic loop in the stochastic quantization scheme we only considerthe spherical limit however as we have seen above the behaviour of the sphericallimit for µ   is in a sense nonperturbative it is not unreasonable to expect thefull nonperturbative result to have a similar qualitative but more smoothed outbehaviourfrom identiﬁcation through the dual of the feynman diagram expansion inthe hermitian matrix model we know that the operator representing the insertionof an n polygonal loop is given by w n in this way we can identify l with a macroscopic length of the loop a being identiﬁedwith the lattice spacing introducing the scaled variables  in  we getl w up to now the there has been no diﬀerence between negative and positivecosmological constants µ however the cutstructures of πuf pz  qfrom the classic work  of brezin et alit is known that if the eigenvaluedistribution of the dmatrix model in the large n limit is given by uy deﬁnedon an interval yl yr then the resolvent f z deﬁned byf z  z yryldyuymatrix model solution the triangles onto ﬁg using the conventions of refthe remaining line in ﬁg is calculated in the kdv ﬂow method the errorsin this line are negligable   although the three graphs clearly diﬀer it isintriguing that they are qualitatively so similarthe translation from the conventions of ref to those of ref is as followsp  p   conclusionsas shown above the kdv ﬂow symmetry of d quantum gravity is brokennonperturbatively by the real solution provided by stochastic quantization schemesince another scheme exists which preserves these ﬂows nonperturbatively andwhich allows for a real solution  and since we have found no obvious unphysicalbehaviour of physical observables in the two schemes as discussed in sec  oneis left with ambiguities on the one hand we have the general method of stochasticstabilization of bottomless actions  which works in any dimension as alreadypointed out in ref it disagrees with the stabilization via contour rotation  in d gravity the contour rotation method satisfy the kdvﬂow symmetrybut leads to unacceptable complex solutions on the other hand the unique realsolution to  is an alternative candidate for a nonperturbative deﬁnition of dgravity the preference of this deﬁnition to the one of stochastic stabilizationwould amount to the declaration that kdvﬂows are a fundamental property of nonperturbative d quantum gravity keeping in mind on the one hand the ultimategoals of understanding higher dimensional gravity and string theory and on theother the lack of understanding of the fundamental physics behind the kdvﬂowstructure it seems to us rather that the results obtained in this article highlight theneed for a better understanding of the basic principles underlying

    "text": "introductionthe domain of integrable massive quantum ﬁeld theory in + dimensions has broadened considerably over the past few years to include many new models this is dueprimarily to the idea that massive theories can be formulated as integrable perturbationsof conformal ﬁeld theories cft as originally put forward by a zamolodchikov consequently if one perturbs relatively novel conformal ﬁeld theories such as the minimalconformal series  one is certain to obtain new and interesting massive theories exact smatrices have now been proposed for certain perturbations of many

this paper we will be concerned with the φ perturbation of the minimal unitaryseries with central chargec   by some fractional spin supersymmetries  recent support for these conjectures hasbeen provided in studies of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz  though the above properties of the rsg theories are generally accepted a completequantum ﬁeld theoretic basis for some of the essentially onshell

derivation of this latter smatrix was given based on the construction ofsome nonlocal conserved currents in the sinegordon sg model that generate the qconnection with φ perturbed minimal cft was also

limit form a vector space isomorphic to a tensor product of uq sl representations they do not in general obeythe conformal ward identities the violation is due to boundary terms in the integrationover the position of the screening operators it was remarked in that the linearcombinations of such correlators that obey the conformal ward identities are in fact identiﬁed with uq sl singular vectors in the tensor product indeed the step operator isidentiﬁed topologically with a boundary operator acting on relative homology groups so that absolute cycles are in its kernel this gives part of the sos restriction namely therestriction to singular vectorsthe rest of the rsos restriction in the uv limit is understood in terms of the fockspace cohomology deﬁned in  the unitary truncation of the fock space of topologicalcharge   m is the cohomology group ker qm+  it was noted by pasquier andsaleur that this cohomology on the space of singular vectors in the tensor product of+  im qpmspin  representations gives precisely the restricted path space described above in otherwords we see that the discrete series of restricted sg models are given in their uv limit byminimal models in their free ﬁeld representation the restriction in the uv limit consistsof two parts the topological part ensures the validity of conformal ward identities thersos restriction is equivalent to the fock space cohomology which selects irreducibleunitary virasoro representations in the fock spacee remarks on the degenerate vacuum structurefor p    a zamolodchikov has argued from a microscopic analysis that the φperturbation of the minimal conformal models has  and  degenerate vacua respectivelyand interpreted the kinks kjj θi as interpolating the two vacua labeled j and j thefold vacuum degeneracy was checked numerically for p   in   by using the truncatedconformal space approach the qualitative aspects of this picture was extended to all pin  by examining the topological charge of the vertex operators vnm namely since thetopological charge of the operators vn is n and   n  p the minimum topologicalcharge is   p on the other hand classical ﬁeld conﬁgurations of topological charge nsatisfy bβ φ  φ  πn and thus connect the wells in the cosbβφ sg potentialthus the wells are eﬀectively p   in number the problem with the latter argument isthat it does not allow an intrinsic description of these degenerate vacua in terms of theusual properties of the minimal conformal models recently based on the thermodynamicbetheansatz equations of al zamolodchikov klassen and melzer conjectured that thelowest excited states in ﬁnite volume are the local states associated with φnni ininﬁnite volume these states become degenerate with the vacuum and there are preciselyp in number the kink states we have described in the previous section are associatedwith the chiral cft states φi and these are to be interpreted as the ﬁrst excitedstates above the vacua in inﬁnite volumewe now oﬀer some justiﬁcation for the above identiﬁcation of the vacua in the approachwe are developing to do this one must identify a suitable order parameter for the sgtheory one may take the sg ﬁeld φ itself the inﬁnitely many degenerate vacua ofthe cosbβφ potential occur at φ  πnbβ n  zas an order parameter since it is more reﬁned in the landauginzburg description ofthe pth minimal model the landauginzburg scalar ﬁeld was identiﬁed precisely withφ and the landauginzburg potential is of degree p   and can support p  degenerate vacua thus our identiﬁcation of the order parameter is entirely consistentwith the landauginzburg picture considering the feiginfuchs representation of theﬁeld φ one sees that it takes the values  q q  at the wells of the sgpotential since  φk  φ+k+k one can thus associate the degenerate vacuawith the states φnni however the precise connection between the minima of the sgcosine potential and the minima of the landauginzburg potential has not been clariﬁedand is an interesting problemnote that in ﬁnite volume on the cylinder one should not expect that the degeneracyof the classical vacua of the lg potential corresponds to degenerate ground states ofthe quantum theoryindeed tunneling between the minima of the potentials induces asplitting of the energy levels and this explains why the states φnni have nondegenerate energies in the cft the true ground state is described by a wave function onconstant ﬁeld conﬁgurations without nodes the ﬁrst excited states are then described bywave functions with nodes and are obtained from the ground state by applying suitablepolynomials in the order parameter at imaginary time  these polynomials are thenormal ordered powers of the order parameter φ+k+k in the conformal limit andthe coeﬃcients of these polynomials are precisely chosen so that the corresponding statesare eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in the inﬁnite volume limit tunneling is suppressedthe splitting disappears and in the low temperature phase

    "text": "introductionin this talk i will review work done in a series of papers with d bernard g felderand f smirnov    the subject concerns new symmetry structures of integrablequantum ﬁeld theories in  spacetime dimensionsa class of quantum ﬁeld theories of special interest are those which possess asymptoticmassive particle states the quantum mechanical scattering of these states is describedby the socalled smatrix the importance of symmetry in quantum ﬁeld theory has longbeen recognizedin  spacetime dimensions the possible symmetries of the smatrixare severely limited by the colemanmandula theorem which states that such symmetriesare necessarily the tensor product of poincare symmetry with some internal symmetrythough an important result this theorem was rather disappointing since these allowedsymmetries are normally not large enough to provide a nonperturbative solution one ofthe hidden assumptions of the colemanmandula theorem is that the symmetry acts onmultiparticle states as if they were tensor products of particle states more precisely ifq is a conserved charge then it was assumed that its representation on a multiparticlestate which is here denoted as q is given byq  q       +   q       +    +     qin modern mathematical terminology it was assumed that the comultiplication was trivialin  dimensions the only known exception to the colemanmandula theorem is supersymmetry and it is due to the possibility of fermionic currents in d however in lowerdimensions the possibility of more exotic statistics of ﬁelds implies there can be morenontrivial exceptions to the colemanmandula theorem the symmetries i will discuss inthe following are precisely of this nature let me summarize some of the main featuresfor simplicity of the presentation i will limit myself to the sinegordon sg and its grossneveu limit one can construct explicitly some nonlocal conserved currents in the sgwhich generate this symmetry have nontrivial though abelian braiding relations at atopological extension of n   supersymmetry away from this point the conserved curtheory that generate a qdeformation of sl aﬃne lie algebra  dslq  the currentsspecial value of the sg coupling where q  i the dslq symmetry corresponds to arents have fractional spin and the n   symmetry algebra is deformed into the dslqof the coupling constant at this value of the coupling the dslq symmetry becomes thealgebra it is well known that the sg theory possesses sl symmetry at a special valueyangian symmetry the yangian is also a deformation of aﬃne lie algebra however thedeformation preserves the ﬁnite lie subalgebra of the aﬃne lie algebra the conservedcurrents generating the yangian were studied by bernard in  based on some earlier workof luscherwhat is remarkable about these symmetries is that they are large enough to providea nonperturbative solution to the smatrix of the theory requiring that the conservedcharges commute with the smatrix leads to a set of algebraic equations which characterizethe smatrix up to an overall scalar factor this scalar can be ﬁxed by imposing crossingsymmetry unitarity and the minimality criterion in the simple cases we are consideringthe smatrices are known these smatrices were originally found by imposing theyangbaxter equation whereas in our approach the solutions to the symmetry equationsautomatically satisfy the yangbaxter equation this parallels what was accomplished bydrinfeld and jimbo in their work on quantum groups  these authors understood thatwhat underlies certain solutions of the yangbaxter equation is a hopf algebra indeedthe algebraic symmetry equations we obtain are wellknown equations in the theory ofquantum groupsthe framework based on nonlocal charges is applicable to many more models than theones considered in detail here the analysis of the sg theory extends readily to the aﬃnetoda theories and their yangian limit more complicated examples include the manyintegrable perturbations of rational conformal ﬁeld theories for example a restriction ofthe quantum aﬃne symmetry of the sg theory can be used to derive the smatrices forthe φ perturbations of the c   minimal conformal models this was developed indetail in  quantum aﬃne symmetry in perturbed minimal models was also discussedby mathur the primary distinction between the latter work and the results presentedhere is that we deal only with genuine symmetries of a theory which means symmetries thatfollow from conserved currents whose charges commute with the smatrix the quantumgroup structure in  is not of this type but rather is more in the spirit of the quantumgroup symmetry of conformal ﬁeld theory as presented in since the nonlocal conserved charges virtually characterize the smatrix completelyit is natural to suppose that they will provide nonperturbative oﬀshell information aswell fields are completely characterized by their form factors ie matrix elements onthe space of states   for the usual internal symmetries based on ﬁnite dimensionallie algebras the implication of the symmetry is that ﬁelds are classiﬁed according toﬁnite dimensional representations of the lie algebra in  this notion was generalized totheories with an arbitrary hopf algebra symmetry by introducing an adjoint action of thehopf algebra on the space of ﬁelds similar algebraic constructions were made in a latticecontext in  for the case of inﬁnite hopf algebra symmetry that we are interested inthe ﬁelds were shown to comprise inﬁnite dimensional vermamodule representationsi will begin by reviewing some general features of nonlocal charges in d quantum ﬁeldtheory in particular it will be shown how the comultiplication for the charges arisesfrom the braiding of the currents with other ﬁelds this connection was also observedby gomez and sierra in their study of ﬁnite dimensional quantum group symmetry ofconformal ﬁeld theory i will then construct explicitly the dslq currents of the sgtheory and determine their algebra the construction of  will then be presented general aspects of nonlocal chargesconsider some conserved currents µj aµ   deﬁning some conserved charges qa using the

    "text": "introductiona wealth of physical information about a relativistic quantum particle theory is contained in the knowledge of the asymptotic particle states and their scattering matrix thisincludes all thermodynamic quantities of an inﬁnitevolume gas of these particles as longas the gas is dilute enough so that a particle description is valid there is a closedformexpression for the virial coeﬃcients terms in the expansion of the free energy in the fugacity depending only on the smatrix doing the calculation in this manner is usuallyunwieldy and unnecessary because one can generally calculate thermodynamic quantitiesdirectly from perturbative ﬁeld theory however the situation is markedly diﬀerent in+dimensional integrable theories here the smatrix has a number of properties whichsimplify matters a great deal it is completely elastic momenta are conserved individuallyin a collision the nbody smatrix factorizes into a product of twobody ones and oneoften can derive or conjecture it exactly it is in principle possible to calculate thesequantities using perturbed conformal ﬁeld theory but using the smatrix is often moretractable and if the smatrix is exact the results are nonperturbativethe techniques for calculating the casimir energy the lowest eigenvalue of the onedimensional quantum hamiltonian were ﬁrst used in the nonrelativistic case in  recently there has been a great deal of interest in this ﬁeld because the study of perturbedconformal ﬁeld theory has enabled conjectures for a large number of exact smatricesthe calculation of the casimir energy in such a case goes by the name of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz tba for short and was ﬁrst done for the yanglee model and thethreestate potts model in ref this paper will discuss modiﬁcations of these techniquesrecently proposed in  which enable the calculation of energies of excited statesthe result of the tba is a set of coupled integral equations one for each particlein the spectrum these equations give the exact casimir energy as a function of thevolume of space although one can solve these equations only numerically it is possibleto extract either the infrared or ultraviolet asymptotics the ultraviolet limit is wherethe theory becomes a conformal ﬁeld theory and thus the results can be compared withresults at the conformal point the results of this paper will be compared to conformalﬁeld theories with a variety of boundary conditions the tba equations have beenstudied in a large variety of exactly solvable theories including the xxz spin chain in amagnetic ﬁeld and its generalizations the supersymmetric sinegordon modelall the simplylaced aﬃne toda theories a number of nonunitary modelsthe perturbed minimal models and the perturbed n and n supersymmetricminimal models some of these results may even be experimentally veriﬁablethe tba allows the calculation of thermodynamic quantities for a onedimensionalsystem where the spatial dimension is a circle of

ﬁeld theory where the additional dimension is a circle of circumference r t  this is therefore equivalent to a twodimensional theory with spacetime a torus ofperiodicity r l we can view either the

that of section  we ﬁnd the appropriate quantization of momenta inperiodic boundary conditions and use this as a constraint while minimizing the free energythis results in an integral equation for the pseudoenergy ǫθ and an expression for thefree energy in terms of ǫθ if there are no particles neutral under k the asymptoticsof these equations are obtainable allowing the calculation of the conformal

true even in the unrestrictedcase the crucial eﬀect of the restriction is that the entropy from only one species ofeach multiplet contributes to the free energy this is because in order to specify a

numerical results for n odd beyond lowest orderdo not agree with perturbation theory around the conformal point the second is that oneexpects the ﬂows in minimal models to take the φii operator in the nth minimal modelto the φii operator in the n  th minimal model this is true here only for nevenso while our result shows that excited states in the staircase model resemble those inthe minimal models in some respects there is a crucial diﬀerence although the ﬂow downthe chain of operators seems very natural from the pointofview of the staircase modelits relation to ﬂows in the minimal models is still not completely clear conclusions and speculationswe have seen that the tba is useful for calculating not only the casimir energy ofthe lowestenergy state in the theory but for a number of excited states as well this isdone by choosing the boundary conditions to project out the ground state in the limitr   all of the states discussed here have e   and become degenerate with theground state it is not clear if it will be possible to project out all such states and obtaininformation on massive states in the manner of the most obvious open direction is to understand how these results can be used tostudy excited states in theories with nondiagonal smatrices where one must introducemassless pseudoparticles into the tba tba equations in some such situations havebeen conjectured but it is not obvious how to interpret these equations as boundaryconditions on the ﬁeld theory however this hopefully is only an interpretational issueall the formalism should be applicable to these casesthere are many other operator expectation values that one can calculate for exampleit is straightforward to calculate  na  for any particle a in a diagonal scatteringtheory since na is a symmetry of the smatrix even if it is not a symmetry of the ﬁeldtheory or of the fusion rules the interpretation of this in terms of boundary conditionsis not immediately obvious however in the minimal models on the lattice on and oﬀcriticality it is possible to deﬁne boundary conditions so that any of the primary operatorscreates the lowestenergy state this seems to be true for all rational conformal ﬁeldtheories as well it is thus not diﬃcult to believe that once suitable ways are foundof implementing the boundary conditions one will be able to calculate the energy for allsuch excited states by calculating operator expectation values with the tbaacknowledgementsi would like to thank ken intriligator tim klassen kolya reshetikhin and cumrunvafa for helpful and interesting conversations i

    "text": "introductionthe liouville ﬁeld theory approach to d quantum gravity and noncritical string theoryarises naturally from the geometry of the d worldsheet  yet despite the classical integrability of the theory its quantization is still incompletely understood progress was madeby assuming free ﬁeld operator product expansions to compute the scaling dimensions ofexponential operators  the results agree with the worldsheet lightcone gauge approach with matrix models  and topological ﬁeld theory  still liouville dynamics is notcompletely equivalent to that of free ﬁeld theory in general  more recently it wasproposed to push the free ﬁeld approach yet one step further and to compute correlationfunctions as in free ﬁeld theory but with the liouville exponential

arbitrary externalstates in the kac table of bosonic minimal models  the integration over the constantliouville mode which yields the screening charge interpretation to the liouville interactiongives rise to a single screening insertion in the liouville sector this is to be contrasted withthe approach of  where the presence of the two liouville screening charges is postulatedstill our ﬁnal results agree with those of  and also with matrix model calculationsthe number of screening charges s brought down by integrating out the constantliouville mode is not in general an integer in this approachin  it was proposed torearrange the explicit answer for integer s in a form that formally makes sense for all complexs the justiﬁcation for this procedure is incomplete two meromorphic functions in s

gotten by formal continuation directlywith the liouville functional integral we know already that these two expressions agree onall positive integer values of s furthermore we clearly have a meromorphic function of sthus in order to show that the formal continued formula indeed yields the answer for thefunctional integral for all s it is necessary to verify that the asymptotic behavior as

conformal ﬁeld theory a crucial ingredient in their method is a formal continuation of an identity shown onthe integers to noninteger values which was justiﬁed using a semiclassical analysis in in

    "text": "introduction and summaryin a recent paper  we identiﬁed the mechanism by which we believe that quantum mechanics is reconciled with general relativity in the context of string theoryin a twodimensional target spacetime this identiﬁcation was based on studiesof c   matrix models  that solve in a certain limit twodimensional quantumgravity with matter coupled to a liouville mode the latter can be seen to correspond to coset su the inﬁnity of conserved charges of the matrix model viewed as the last stage ofblack hole evaporation which respects the conservation lawssubsequently and independently moore and seiberg  conﬁrmed the association of the inﬁnite set of conserved charges in the c   system with the discretetopological modes of the twodimensional string by showing that for the particularvalues of energy and momentum that characterised the discrete highspin modesone can ﬁnd ﬁeld transformations that leave the action of the matrix model inthe fermion formalism invariant they showed that these transformations generate w+symmetries for the target spacetime in particular they found a largerinﬁnite set of conserved charges as compared to the results of  which obey thecommutation relations of a w+algebra the charges of  constitute a commutingsubset cartan subalgebra of this algebra in this way moore and seiberg conﬁrmedthe existence of whair characterising the black hole solution of the associated σmodel theory for completeness we review their results in the fermion formalism ofthe c   matrix modelthe action takes the forms view of the conjectured equivalence of the matrix model and σmodel formalism oneexpects that upon bosonising the theory by taking into account the extra operatorsone would recover this set of symmetries as target spacetime symmetries of thecorresponding +dimensional σmodel in this way the conserved charges couldbe expressed as functionals of the targetspace backgrounds integrated over thespace liouville coordinate of the twodimensional string  in this frameworkthe symmetries of the matrix model could be viewed as exact anomalyfree targetspace gauge symmetries of the σmodel formulated in higher generathere are two ways in which such symmetries are realised in the σmodel approach to string theory in one of them the symmetries correspond to redeﬁnitionsδx of the σmodel target space coordinates x that leave the fradkintseytlin ftfunctional invariant  in this way the symmetries are dissociated at least formally from the conformally invariant critical point given that the ft generatingfunctional can be deﬁned away from the ﬁxed point  in the alternative approach conformal invariance of the underlying worldsheet ﬁeld theory is essential inthis approach the symmetries are associated with a family of string vacua a targetspace stringy symmetry in this case would imply the existence of inﬁnitesimal orﬁnite conformal ﬁeld theory operators that generate isomorphisms between conformal ﬁeld theories with target space ﬁelds gi and gi + δgi  the formalcriteria for such a symmetry can be summarised as follows i any inﬁnitesimal worldsheet operator h generates an isomorphism betweenconformal ﬁeld theories with stress tensors t and t + ih t  ii two conformal ﬁeld theories with stress tensors that diﬀer by an operator χof conformal spin  correspond to backgrounds that diﬀer by an inﬁnitesimalchange appropriate to χ this follows from the assumption that in a σmodellanguage one considers as physical background spacetime ﬁelds the ones that arein onetoone correspondence with primary ﬁelds of dimension   however thisrestriction does not prevent other operators of the theory from being important indetermining the structure of spacetime symmetries as we shall discuss shortlyiii symmetries of the target space of the string are therefore generated bycurrents j of conformal spin  or  this is so because in that case the charger dσj  h has the property that ih t   χ it is understood that appropriate extensions to ﬁnite transformations are expectedto hold but the situation is not clear discrete string symmetries might form adiﬀerent category although the belief is that they also can be incorporated in thesecond schemeit is not clear at present whether the two approaches are equivalent certainlythere are examples where a change of variables in the ft functional induces nontrivial changes in the background ﬁelds but it is not yet known whether this includesthe full set of stringy symmetries  we conjecture  that in the particular case oftwodimensional strings the w+symmetry of the target space can be representedas a change in σmodel ﬁelds we base this conjecture mainly on intuition at thisstage but also on some preliminary results in simpliﬁed systems characterised bywsymmetries  our intuition is based on the socalled w gravity systems whichare known to possess extended conformal symmetries  for instance the actionof a twodimensional free complex scalar ﬁeld r dzφlevels   they would correspond to higherspin massive string states  the existence of such operators and the corresponding ward identities in the matrix model certainly points in this direction but more work needs to be done especially inhigher genera before rigorous results are derivedrecently witten  has managed to exhibit a larger symmetry for the c  matrix model by making use of new discrete states of nonstandard ghost numberwhich were known in the previous literature  but not extensively discussed thebasic feature is the existence of modes of ghost number zero and conformal spin zerothat form a ring the socalled ground ring in terms of matrix models this ringhelps in understanding the symmetry of the system which is nothing other than aphasespace areapreserving transformation that leaves the fermi surface invariantit is important that the worldsheet currents that generate this particular lie algebra of symmetries are operators of nonstandard ghost number but of conformalspin   andor   given that in the discussion we gave above on hiddensymmetries in string theory the ghost number seems to play no essential role wehave an understanding of this symmetry as an ordinary stringy symmetry of targetspacetime of a twodimensional σmodel the fact that the symmetry is known ina closed form is due to the low dimensionality of target space the symmetry isbigger than that discussed previously    but the extra symmetries are quitetrivial as far as the matrix model is concerned however they are important inthe conformal ﬁeld theory framework as we mentioned in the beginning of thearticle it has been known for some time  that walgebras are associated withspeciﬁc areapreserving diﬀeomorphisms for ﬁelds of high spin but the connectionwith string theory had not been clearin the body of this note we develop a physical interpretation of this remarkableobservation in the context of the symplectic geometry of hamiltonian dynamicsspeciﬁcally it ensures that the matrix models time evolution respects liouvillestheorem which is a necessary condition for canonical quantisation comparing witha generalised evolution equation for the density matrix proposed previously  toaccommodate the breakdown of quantum coherence conjectured by hawking we demonstrate the vanishing of the extra term that otherwise would allow purestates to evolve into mixed ones the basic feature is that the extra terms violatethe exact stringy symmetry of the model which is expressed as the transformationpreserving the phasespace volume element  this geometric viewpoint on therestoration of quantum coherence in twodimensional strings probably opens newways to attack similar problems in higherdimensional string theories we alsorecall that the areapreserving diﬀeomorphims of the matrix model leave invariantthe fermi surface  an analogous result in fourdimensional ﬁeld theory wouldreﬂect the existence of a large string symmetry interelating vacua with the samevalue of the cosmological constant λ assuming the existence of a supersymmetricvacuum with zero cosmological constant λ   the spontaneous breakdown of thislarge string symmetry would leave string in some asymmetric vacuum with λ   the matrix model black holes and spacetimefoamhowever there is a nontrivial conjecture that one has to make about the nature ofthe matrix model in order to apply the above arguments the conjecture concernsthe role of the black hole as well as spacetime foam in this context the matrixmodel is believed to be the last stage of black hole evaporation  black holesolutions have been discussed so far in the context of solving βfunction conditionsfor σmodels formulated on genus zero while the matrix model is considered as astringy regularisation of worldsheet quantum gravity where the summation overgenera is done exactlyit is quite plausible that higher genus corrections do notdestroy the black hole character of the tree level conditions and this will be assumedin the following the black hole solution is asymptotic at spatial inﬁnity to a spacetime which is exactly that of a matrix model the symmetries of the matrix model inthis way become asymptotic symmetries of spacetime in the presence of a black holethat can be assumed to evaporate somehow given that under time evolution thephase space of the matrix model which is essentially the phase space of c   matterinteracting with the black hole is preserved as a result of the stringy symmetry onehas an elegant geometric interpretation of the maintenance of quantum coherencein the systemis that the end of the story in other words is the classical black hole backgroundand its evaporation the only source of loss of coherence in the system one mightnaively answer positively given that after the black hole evaporates one recoversﬂat spacetime and the problem of deﬁning an smatrix that factorises in the caseof matrix model seems quite natural and somehow trivial however the essentialpoint that will concern us below lies in the fact that if one takes the dynamics ofspacetime seriously in the case of c   theories there are additional complicationseven after the black hole evaporation that can be seen on a microscopic scale theproblems come from the observation that a backgroundindependent formalism ofthe dasjevicki action  is possible which implies that if one considers quantumﬂuctuations around any background then creation and annihilation of virtual blackholes may occur and as a result spacetime foam will appearlet us be more precise first we argue how one can formally achieve a backgroundindependent formulation from the collective ﬁeld theory approach to the matrixmodel   it becomes evident the latter yields a string ﬁeld theory of tachyonsthat propagate in a ﬂat spacetime conﬁguration where the dilaton ﬁeld is linearin the the spatial coordinate and all the rest of the higherspin string modes arevanishing the reason for having a tachyon ﬁeld theory and not simply a classicalbackground is simple one starts from the partition function of the lattice modeland then makes a change of variables which is a canonical transformation thatleaves invariant the classical phasespace volume element following  to passto a target space ﬁeld formalismin this way the collective ﬁeld coordinate isintegrated over in the path integral this coordinate can be seen to correspondto the tachyon ﬁeld   there is no dynamics in the matrix model for thehighspin string modes by construction from classical symmetry considerations however one can anticipate a backgroundindependent formalism which willenable one to integrate over the spacetime ﬁelds and obtain a quantum string ﬁeldtheory to this end one has ﬁrst to covariantise the dasjevicki action that this ispossible follows directly from the fact that the amplitudes of the dasjevicki theoryare nothing other than string theory amplitudes for the tachyon ﬁeld in a twodimensional target space  the insertion of gravitondilaton states with genericmomenta in tachyonic amplitudes can be seen to yield vanishing results which canbe interpeted  as arising from certain stringy ward identities expressing generalcovariance of the theoryin this way general covariance is viewed as one of thethe inﬁnite gauge symmetries of the twodimensional string associated with massivehighspin levels  it is straightforward  following the dictionary outlined in  to express the dasjevicki lagrangian in terms of a tachyon ﬁeld propagatingin nontrivial generic graviton and dilaton backgrounds the result is an eﬀectiveaction involving an inﬁnite number of derivatives describing the interaction of thetachyon with these ﬁelds the inﬁnite derivative order is immediately seen from thefact that the dasjevicki lagrangian  for the collective ﬁeld φx t contains in thescaling limit kinetic terms of the formz dxthe chemical potential of the matrix model  it should be noted that µf is essentialfor the nonperturbative ﬁeldtheoretic quantum corrections we are interested inalthough it may be ignored when one considers only classical tachyon backgrounds to get a covariant form one may redeﬁne the collective ﬁeld by looking atﬂuctuations around static classical minima vx   as a su hence in principle the modiﬁcation of the quantum mechanical evolution suggested in  could apply however this might not be the case due to stringysymmetries as we shall argue below there is also a nice geometric intepretationof these symmetries which also illuminates the relation between matrix model andstring theory in ﬁxed backgrounds the symplectic geometry of quantum coherencewe now proceed to demonstrate the geometric origin of the argued restorationof quantum coherence in the twodimensional string to understand better theproblem and its solution in the matrix model framework it is ﬁrst useful to recallsome facts about the possible modiﬁcations of quantum mechanics as a result ofsingular spacetime metrics consider a quantum mechanical problem described by a hamiltonian hp q anda density matrix ρp q t in conventional quantum mechanics the time evolutionof the density matrix is given byρ already in ref  hawking had proposed that once nonperturbative metricﬂuctuations were taken into account the usual smatrix relation between initial andﬁnal states should be replaced by a general linear relationρout  sρinwhere s cannot in general be factorised into the product of s and s as in conventional quantum ﬁeld theory it was suggested in ref that the correspondingmodiﬁcation of eq  would beρfollowing witten  we consider the matrix model hamiltonian which has thestandard inverted harmonic oscillator formhp q anticipate that such an extension is possiblein this case taking into accountthe above interpretation of the role of spacetime foam in this context and theconnection of the asymptotic states of the black hole to the matrix model onehas an elegant geometric interpretation of the restoration of quantum coherence inthe twodimensional string theory the basic feature is the existence of a stringysymmetry associated with various string excitations which characterises the groundstate of the system as a result the extra term in  that would spoil conventionalquantum mechanics is forced to vanish as it is incompatible with the symmetriesof the theory this happens due to the fact that the symmetry in question ﬁndsa nice interpretation as a phasespace volumepreserving diﬀeomorphism which isprecisely the property violated in the modiﬁed evolution equation  the existenceof the whair  that characterises the asymptotic states of the black hole matrixmodel certainly oﬀers ﬁeldtheoretic support to these argumentsthe areapreserving diﬀeomorphisms in phase space are a feature of the w algebras  discussed at the beginning of this article it should be stressed that thewsymmetry that characterises the standard ghost number discrete states of highspin is included in the above symmetry as we mentioned above from the matrix model point of view the extra symmetries are trivial and do not lead to extraconserved charges one should probably anticipate that the charges discussed previously associated with the standard ghost number string states are the only onesthat characterise the conformal ﬁeld theory and therefore the black hole solutionshowever it is the entire spectrum of string states including the nonstandard ghostnumber ones that are really responsible for the maintenance of quantum coherence and the restoration of the relation between symmetries and conservation lawshence it seems that it is the particularity of whair which is areapreserving andcharacterises the twodimensional black hole that is relevant for the reconciliationof quantum mechanics and general relativity and that just having an inﬁnity ofconserved charges may not suﬃcein view of this result one might speculate that if the above scenario is to be carriedthrough in higher dimensional spacetimes it is necessary that there exist analogousinﬁnitedimensional symmetries associated with areapreserving diﬀeomorphisms insome phase space variables one might need something like the walgebras thatcharacterise fourdimensional selfdual euclidean einstein spaces  there it isknown that fourdimensional selfdual einstein gravity follows as the large nlimit ofa twodimensional wesszumino sun σmodel inﬁnitedimensional symmetriesof einsteins equations are shown to form a walgebra the selfduality of themodel may not be essential  for the existence of inﬁnite dimensional integrabilityand one might hope that nonselfdual fourdimensional gravity models obtainedfrom string theories with higherdimensional target spaces might possess extendedconformal symmetries of the typed discussed in this note remarks on the cosmological constant problemafter these speculative remarks about the possible extension of our ideas to higherdimensional spacetimes we conclude with some comments on the cosmological constant in the light of the above insights into matrix models witten  has observedthat the inﬁnite set of string symmetries that preserve the twodimensional
