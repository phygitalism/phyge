    "text": "introductionalthough the purpose of this workshop is to discuss the structures in the universewhich are inhomogeneous homogeneous models have been used in considering manyof the cosmological issues raised in that discussion so i have also included in this survey the anisotropic homogeneous models and their implications only exact solutionswill be covered other speakers at pont doye eg bardeen brandenberger dunsbyand ellis gave very full discussions of perturbation theory here i continue my previous practice maccallum   by using the mathematical classiп¬Ѓcation ofthe solutions as an overall scheme of organization the earlier reviews give additionaldetails and references a survey organized by the nature of the applications is toappear in the proceedings of dennis sciamas th birthday meeting other usefulreviews are ryan and shepley  on homogeneous anisotropic models krasinski on inhomogeneous models and verdaguer   on models of solitoniccharacterin section  i will consider the spatiallyhomogeneous but anisotropic modelsthese are the bianchi models in general the exceptions being the kantowskisachsmodels with an s  r topology such models could be signiп¬Ѓcant in understandingthe background in which structure is formed but they do not themselves model thatstructure however i will include here some remarks about inhomogeneous modelswhich are closely related to calculations done with bianchi models then in section i will consider the inhomogeneous models which fall into several classes theycan be used both as local models of structure and as possible global models of thebackground in which structure forms and are in some cases used for both purposessimultaneously a п¬Ѓnal section attempts a synthesis and makes some summarizingremarkswhat is it that a cosmological model should explain there are the followingmain features lumpiness or the clumping of matter the evidence for this is obvious expansion shown by the hubble law evolution shown by the radio source counts and more recently by galaxycounts a hot dense phase to account for the cosmic microwave background radiationcmwbr and the abundances of the chemical elements isotropy shown to a high degree of approximation in various cosmological observations but especially in the cmwbr possibly homogeneity the doubt indicated here will be explained later the numerical values of parameters of the universe and its laws such as thebaryon number density the total density parameter П‰ the entropy per baryonand the coupling constants perhaps such features as the presence of lifeoriginally the standard bigbang models were the friedmanlemaЛ†Д±trerobertsonwalker flrw models characterized as isotropic at all points and thus necessarily   spatiallyhomogeneous implying robertsonwalker geometry satisfying einsteins п¬Ѓeld equations at recent times for about the last  years pressureless and thus governedby the friedmanlemaЛ†Д±tre dynamics at early times radiationdominated giving the tolman dynamics and a thermal history including the usual account of nucleogenesis and the microwavebackgroundto this picture which was the orthodox view from about  the last decadehas added the following extra orthodoxies П‰   thus there is dark matter for which the cold dark matter model waspreferred inп¬‚ation  a period in the early universe where some п¬Ѓeld eп¬Ђectively mimicsa large cosmological constant and so causes a period of rapid expansion longenough to multiply the initial length scale many times nonlinear clustering on galaxy cluster scales modelled by the nbody simulations which п¬Ѓt correlation functions based on observationsand also added as alternatives such concepts as cosmic strings guts or toes andso onthe standard model has some clear successes it certainly п¬Ѓts the hubble law thesource count evolutions in principle if not in detail the cosmic microwave spectrumthe chemical abundances the measured isotropies and the assumption of homogeneity perhaps its greatest success was the prediction that the number of neutrinospecies should be  and could not be more than  a prediction now fully borne outby the lep datahowever the model still has weaknesses maccallum  for example the trueclumping of matter on large scales as shown by the qdot data saunders et al and the angular correlation functions of galaxies maddox et al  is too strongfor the standard cold dark matter account the uniformity of the hubble п¬‚ow isunder question from the work of the seven samurai lyndenbell et al  andothers the question of the true value of П‰ has been reopened partly because theoryhas shown that inп¬‚ation does not uniquely predict П‰   cf ellis talk at pontdoye and partly because observations give somewhat variant values some authorshave pointed out that our knowledge of the physics valid at nucleogenesis and beforeis still somewhat uncertain and that we should thus retain some agnosticism towardsour account of those early timesfinally we should recognize that our belief in homogeneity on a large scale hasvery poor observational support we have data from our past light cone and thoseof earlier human astronomers and from geological records hoyle  studyingspatial homogeneity requires us to know about conditions at great distances at thepresent time whereas what we can observe at great distances is what happened along time ago so to test homogeneity we have to understand the evolution both ofthe universes geometry and of its matter content thus we cannot test homogeneityonly check that it is consistent with the data and our understanding of the theorythe general belief in homogeneity is indeed like the zeal of the convert since untilthe s when baade revised the distance scale the accepted distances and sizes ofgalaxies were not consistent with homogeneitythese comments however are not enough to justify examination of other modelswhy do we do that the basic reason is to study situations where the flrw modelseven with linearized perturbations may not be adequate three types of situationcome to mind the fully nonlinear modelling of local processes exploration of theuniqueness of features of the flrw models and tests of the viability of nonflrwmodels the uniqueness referred to here may lie in characteristics thought to bepeculiar to the standard model in attempted proofs that no model universe couldbe anisotropic or inhomogeneous by proving that any strong departures from thestandard model decay away during evolution or in comparisons with observation toshow that only the standard models п¬Ѓtsome defects of the present survey should be noted one is that the matter contentis generally assumed to be a perfect п¬‚uid although this is strictly incompatible withthe other assumed physical properties attempting to remedy this with some othermathematically convenient equation of state is not an adequate response one must tryto base the description of matter on a realistic model of microscopic physics or thermodynamics and few have considered such questions bradley and sviestins salvati et al  bona and coll  romano and pavon a second limitation is that we can only explore the mathematically tractablesubsets of models which may be far from representative of all models to avoidthis restriction we will ultimately have to turn to numerical simulations includingfully threedimensional variations in the initial data some excellent pioneering workhas of course been done eg anninos et al b but capabilities are still limitedfor example matzner  could only use a space grid of  points and  timesteps moreover before one can rely on numerical simulations one needs to provesome structural stability results to guarantee that the numerical and exact answerswill correspondas a п¬Ѓnal limitation in giving this review i only had time to mention and discusssome selected papers and issues not survey the whole vast п¬Ѓeld for his mammothsurvey of all inhomogeneous cosmological models which contain as a limiting case theflrw models krasinski now has read about  papers as reported at the grconference in  thus the bibliography is at best a representative selection frommany worthy and interesting papers and authors whose work is unkindly omittedmay quite reasonably feel it is unrepresentative in particular i have not attemptedto cover the higherdimensional models discussed by demaret and others spatiallyhomogeneous anisotropic models metrics and п¬Ѓeld equationsas already mentioned this class consists of the bianchi and kantowskisachs modelsthey have the advantage that the einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinarydiп¬Ђerential equations enabling the use of techniques from dynamical systems theoryand there is thus again a vast literature too big to fully survey herethe bianchi models can be deп¬Ѓned as spacetimes with metricsds  dt + gО±ОІteО±ВµdxВµeОІОЅdxОЅwhere the corresponding basis vectors eО± obeyeО± eОІ  c ОіО±ОІeОіin which the cs are the structure constants of the relevant symmetry group thediп¬Ђerent bianchibehr types iix are then deп¬Ѓned see eg kramer et al  byalgebraic classiп¬Ѓcation of these sets of structure constantsthe kantowskisachs metric isds  dt + at dx + btdОё + sin Оё dП†the other metric given in the original paper of kantowski and sachs was in fact abianchi metric as pointed out by ellisthe adoption of methods from the theory of dynamical systems has considerablyadvanced the studies of the behaviour of bianchi models beginning in the early swith the discussion of phase portraits for special cases collins  subsequentlymore general cases were discussed using a compactiп¬Ѓed phase space in the last decadethese methods have been coupled with the parametrization of the bianchi models using automorphism group variables collins and hawking  harvey jantzen  siklos  roque and ellis  jaklitsch the automorphism group can be brieп¬‚y described as follows take a transformationЛ†eО±  m О±ОІeОІthis is an automorphism of the symmetry group if the Л†eО± obey the same commutation relations as the eО± the matrices m are timedependent and are chosenso that the new metric coeп¬ѓcients Л†gО±ОІ take some convenient form for examplebecome diagonal the real dynamics is in these metric coeп¬ѓcients this idea ispresent in earlier treatments which grew from misners methods for the mixmastercase ryan and shepley  but unfortunately the type ix case was highly misleading in that for bianchi ix and no others except bianchi i the rotation group isan automorphism groupthe compactiп¬Ѓcation of phase space introduced for general cases by sp novikovand bogoyavlenskii see bogoyavlenskii  entailed the normalization of conп¬Ѓguration variables to lie within some bounded region which was then exploited bya п¬Ѓnding lyapunov functions driving the system near the boundaries of the phasespace and b using analyticity together with the behaviour of critical points andseparatrices to derive the asymptotic behaviourthree main groups have developed these treatments bogoyavlenskii and his colleagues op cit jantzen rosquist and collaborators eg jantzen  rosquistet al  who have coupled the automorphism variables with hamiltonian treatments in a powerful formalism and wainwright and colleagues eg wainwright andhsu  who have used a diп¬Ђerent and in some respects simpler set of automorphism variables which are wellsuited for studying asymptotic behaviour becausetheir limiting cases are physical evolutions of simpler models rather than singularbehaviours similar ideas can be used for the kantowskisachs models too as wellas qualitative results some of them described below these methods have enablednew exact solutions to be found and some general statements about the occurrenceof these solutions to be mademany of the geometrical properties of bianchi cosmologies can be carried over tocases where the dimensional symmetry group which is still classiп¬Ѓable by bianchitype acts on timelike surfaces a number of authors have considered such metricsfor example harness  and myself and siklos  although of less interestsince they do not evolve in time than the usual bianchi models some of these modelsreappear as spatially inhomogeneous static or stationary models belowsince the presentday universe is not so anisotropic that we can readily detect itsshear and vorticity the bianchi models can be relevant to cosmology only as modelsof asymptotic behaviour in the early or late universe or over long time scales suchas the time since the last scattering they have also been used in these contextsas approximations in genuinely inhomogeneous universes and one has to be carefulto distinguish the approximate and exact uses asymptotic behaviour the far past and futurethe earliest use of anisotropic cosmological models to study a real cosmological problem was the investigation by lemaЛ†Д±tre  of the occurrence of singularities inbianchi type i models the objective was to explore whether the bigbang whicharose in flrw models was simply a consequence of the assumed symmetry it wasof course found not to beone can argue that classical cosmologies are irrelevant before the planck timebut until a theory of quantum gravity is established and experimentally veriп¬Ѓed ifindeed that will ever be possible there will be room for discussions of the behaviourof classical models near their singularitiesin the late s and early s lifshitz and khalatnikov and their collaboratorsshowed a that singularities in synchronous coordinates in inhomogeneous cosmologies were in general п¬Ѓctitious and b that a special subclass gave real curvaturesingularities with an asymptotic behaviour like that of the kasner vacuum bianchii cosmology lifshitz and khalatnikov  from these facts they wrongly inferred that general solutions did not have singularities this contradicted the latersingularity theorems for which see hawking and ellis  a disagreement whichled to the belief that there were errors in lks arguments they themselves in collaboration with belinskii and independently misner showed that bianchi ix modelsgave a more complicated oscillatory behaviour than had been discussed in the earlier work and misner christened this the mixmaster universe after a brand of foodmixer the broad picture of the rЛ†oles of the kasnerlike and oscillatory behaviourshas been borne out by the more rigorous studies by the methods described in theprevious section there is also an interesting and as yet incompletely explored resultthat after the oscillatory phase many models approximate one of a few particularpowerlaw selfsimilar solutions bogoyavlenskii the detailed behaviour of the mixmaster model has been the subject of stillcontinuing investigations some authors argue that the evolution shows ergodic andchaotic properties while others have pointed out that the conclusions depend crucially on the choice of time variable barrow  burd et al  berger numerical investigations are tricky because of the required dynamic range if one isto study an adequately large timeinterval and the diп¬ѓculties of integrating chaoticsystemsthe extension of these ideas to the inhomogeneous case by belinskii lifshitzand khalatnikov has been even more controversial though prompting a smallerliteratureit was strongly attacked by barrow and tipler  on a number oftechnical grounds but one can take the view that these were not as damaging to thecase as barrow and tipler suggested belinskii et al  maccallum  indeed the velocitydominated class whose singularities are like the kasner cosmologyhave been more rigorously characterized and the results justiп¬Ѓed eardley et al holmes et al  sadly this does not settle the more general question and attempts to handle the whole argument on a completely rigorous footing have so farfailedgeneral results about singularity types have been proved the locally extendiblesingularities in which the region around any geodesic encountering the singularitycan be extended beyond the singular point can only exist under strong restrictionsclarke  while the whimper singularities king and ellis  in which curvature invariants remain bounded while curvature components in some frames blowup have been shown to be nongeneric and unstable siklos  examples ofthese special cases were found among bianchi models and both homogeneous andinhomogeneous cosmologies have been used as examples or counterexamples in thedebatea further stimulus to the study of singularities was provided by penroses conjecture that gravitational entropy should be low at the start of the universe and thiswould correspond to a state of small or zero weyl tensor penrose  tod many authors have also considered the far future evolution or in closed modelsthe question of recollapse whose necessity in bianchi ix models lacked a rigorousproof until recently lin and wald  from various works maccallum collins and hawking  barrow and tipler  one п¬Ѓnds that the homogeneousbut anisotropic models do not in general settle down to an flrwlike behaviourbut typically generate shears of the order of  of their expansion rates see alsouggla et al  from the dynamical systems treatments it is found that certain exact solutions which in general have selfsimilarity in time act as attractorsof the dynamical systems in the future wainwright and hsu  all such exact solutions are known see hsu and wainwright  and jantzen and rosquistthis last touches on an interesting question about our account of the evolutionof the universeis it structurally stable or would small changes in the theory ofthe model parameters change the behaviour grossly several instances of the latterphenomenon fragility have recently been explored by tavakol in collaboration withcoley ellis farina van den bergh and others coley and tavakol  long time eп¬Ђects the cosmic microwave backgroundto test the signiп¬Ѓcance of the observed isotropy of the cmwbr many people inthe s and s computed the angular distribution of the cmwbr temperature inbianchi models eg thorne  novikov  collins and hawking  andbarrow et al  these calculations allow limits to be put on small deviationsfrom isotropy from observation and also enabled for example the prediction of hotspots in the cmwbr in certain bianchi models which could in principle be searchedfor if there were a quadrupole component as there is in the cobe data thoughperhaps not for this reason to see if the quadrupole veriп¬Ѓes one of those modelssimilar calculations by fewer people considered the polarization rees anile  tolman and matzner  and spectrum rees  rasband more recently still work has been carried out on the microwave background in someinhomogeneous models saez and arnau  it has been shown that pure rotationwithout shear is not ruled out by the cmwbr obukhov  but this result maybe irrelevant to the real universe where shear is essential to nontrivial perturbationsgoode  dunsby  in any case shearfree models in general relativity are avery restricted class ellis an example of the problem with assuming a perfect п¬‚uid is that in bianchimodels as soon as matter is in motion relative to the homogeneous surfaces iebecomes tilted it experiences density gradients which should lead to heat п¬‚uxesbradley and sviestins  similar remarks apply to other simple models suchmodels have recently been used to п¬Ѓt the observed dipole anisotropy in the cmwbrturner  though other explanations seem to me more credible early universe eп¬Ђectsgalaxy formation in anisotropic models has been studied to see if by this means onecould overcome the wellknown diп¬ѓculties in flrw models without inп¬‚ation butwith negative results perko et al a similar investigation was to see if the helium abundance as known in the scould be п¬Ѓtted better by anisotropic cosmologies than by flrw models which at thetime appeared to give discrepancies the reason this might happen is that anisotropyspeeds up the evolution between the time when deuterium can п¬Ѓrst form becauseit is no longer dissociated by the photons and the time when neutrons and protonsare suп¬ѓciently sparse that they no longer п¬Ѓnd each other to combine hawking andtayler  were pioneers in this eп¬Ђort which continued into the s but suп¬Ђeredsome mutations in its intentionfirst the argument was reversed and the good agreement of flrw predictionswith data was used to limit the anisotropy during the nucleogenesis period see egbarrow  olson  later still these limits were relaxed as a result of considering the eп¬Ђects of anisotropic neutrino distribution functions rothman and matzner and other eп¬Ђects on reaction rates juszkiewicz et al  it has even been shownmatravers et al  barrow  that strongly anisotropic bianchi models notobeying the limits deduced from perturbed flrw models can produce correct element abundances though they may violate other constraints matravers and madsen matravers et al inhomogeneous cosmologies selfsimilar modelssome of the selfsimilar models especially those relevant to modelling structure formation are reviewed in much greater detail in a complementary talk by carr so iwill give here only a few details of other casesthe geometry of the selfsimilar models п¬Ѓrst considered in cosmology is somewhatlike that of the bianchi models except that one of the isometries is replaced by ahomothety that is to say by a vector п¬Ѓeld satisfyingОѕab  kgabwhere k is a constant this class where the homothety and two independent symmetries act was considered by a number of authors eardley  luminet wu  hanquin and demaret  and many details parallel in nature tothose covered by the detailed studies of bianchi models can be found in those worksmore recently wainwright hewitt and colleagues hewitt et al  hewitt and wainwright hewitt et al  have considered cases where the homothety has a timelike ratherthan spacelike generator like the former class these solutions are in fact special casesof g solutions discussed below with perfect п¬‚uid matter content it is found thatthe spatial variations can be periodic or monotone the asymptotic behaviour maybe a vacuum or spatially homogeneous model the periodic cases are unstable toincreases in the anisotropy and the singularities can be accelerationdominated spherically symmetric modelsthese have a metricds  eОЅdt + eО»dr + rdОё + sin Оё dП†where ОЅ О» and r are functions of r and t the precise functional forms in the metricdepend on the choice of coordinates and the additional restrictions assumed it shouldbe noted that there are so few undetermined functions that a suп¬ѓcientlycomplicatedenergymomentum will п¬Ѓt a totally arbitrary choice of the remaining functions in myview this should not be regarded as a solution since no equation is actually solvedsome important subcases have been studied notably the dust pressureless perfect п¬‚uid cases originally studied by lemaЛ†Д±tre butusually named after tolman and bondi mcvitties  solution representing a black hole in an flrw universe the swiss cheese model constructed by matching a schwarzschild vacuumsolution inside some sphere to an exterior flrw universe shearfree п¬‚uid solutions wyman  kustaanheimo and qvist  stephani mcvittie  selfsimilar solutions discussed in carrs contribution at pont doyespherically symmetric models especially tolmanbondi have often been used tomodel galactic scale inhomogeneities in various contexts galaxy formation has beenstudied eg tolman  carr and yahil  meszaros  developed avariation on the usual approach by considering the shellcrossings with the aim ofproducing great wall like structures rather than the collapse to the centre producing a spherical cluster or galaxy some authors have used spherically symmetriclumps to estimate departures from the simple theory of the magnituderedshift relations based on a smoothed out model eg dyer  kantowski a andnewman  note that these works show that the corrections depend on thechoice of modelling since newmans results from a mcvittie model diп¬Ђer from theones based on swiss cheese models the metrics also give the simplest models ofgravitational lenses and have also been used to model the formation of primordialblack holes carr and hawking on a larger scale inhomogeneous spherical spacetimes have been used to modelclusters of galaxies kantowski b variations in the hubble п¬‚ow due to the supercluster mavrides  the evolution of cosmic voids sato  hausman et al bonnor and chamorro  and  the observed distribution of galaxies and simple hierarchical models of the universe bonnor  wesson  wesson ribeiro a most of this work used tolmanbondi models sometimes with discontinuous density distributionsrecent work by ribeiro b in the course of an attempt to make simplemodels of fractal cosmologies using tolmanbondi metrics has reminded us of theneed to compare data with relativistic models not newtonian approximations takingthe einsteinde sitter model and integrating down the geodesics he plotted thenumber counts against luminosity distances at small distances where a simpleinterpretation would say the result looks like a uniform density the graph is irrelevantbecause the distances are inside the region where the qdot survey shows things arelumpy saunders et al  while at greater redshifts the universe ceases to have asimple powerlaw relation of density and distance thus even einsteinde sitter doesnot look homogeneousone must therefore ask in general do homogeneous models look homogeneousof course they will if the data is handled with appropriate relativistic corrections butto achieve such comparisons in general requires the integration of the null geodesicequations in each cosmological model considered and as those who have tried itknow even when solving the п¬Ѓeld equations is simple solving the geodesic equationsmay not bemany other papers have considered spherically symmetric models but there isnot enough space here to review them all so i will end by mentioning a jeu despritin which it was shown that in a swiss cheese model made by joining two flrwexteriors at the two sides of a kruskal diagram for the schwarzschild solution onecan have two universes each of which can receive but not answer a signal from theother sussman  cylindrically symmetric and plane symmetric staticmodelsthese have been used to model cosmic strings and domain walls one should notethat locally the metrics may be the same for these two cases the diп¬Ђerence lying inwhether there is or is not a killing vector whose integral curves have spatial topologys plane symmetric metrics should have a rotational symmetry in the plane butto add to the possible confusions some authors use the term plane for solutionswithout such a rotation the term planar would be a useful alternativethe usual though not the only form for the cylindrically symmetric metrics isds  t dt + rdr + z dz + w dz dП† + П†dП†where t  r z w and П† depend on r and in the nonstationary case t and П† isperiodic and for the plane symmetric caseds  t dt + rdr + x dx + xdП†where t  r and x are functions of r and perhaps t the static cases all belong inharnesss  general classplane symmetric models usually static solutions have been used to model domainwalls vilenkin  ipser and sikivie  goetz  wang b the cylindrically symmetric models have been used for cosmic strings starting with the workof gott hiscock and linet in  these studies have usually been done with staticstrings and have considered such questions as the eп¬Ђects on classical and quantumп¬Ѓelds in the neighbourhood of the string g cosmologiesi use the above title as a general name for all cosmological metrics with two spacelikekilling vectors and hence two essential variables the cylindrical and plane metricsand many of the bianchi metrics are special cases of g cosmologiesg cosmologies admit a number of specializations such as the killing vectors commute the orbits of the g are orthogonal to another set of dimensional surfaces v the killing vectors individually are hypersurfaceorthogonal the matter content satisп¬Ѓes conditions allowing generating techniquesamong the classes of metrics covered here are colliding wave models cosmologies withsuperposed solitonic waves and what i call corrugated cosmologies with spatialirregularities dependent on only one variablethe metrics where the killing vectors do not commute have been very little studied it is known they cannot admit orthogonal v if the п¬‚uid п¬‚ows orthogonal to thegroup surfaces unless they have an extra symmetry and that if the п¬‚uid is thusorthogonal it is nonrotating bugalho  van den bergh  so we now takeonly cases where the killing vectors commutethe case without orthogonal v has also been comparatively little studied butrecently some exact solutions which have one hypersurfaceorthogonal killing vectorand in which the metric coeп¬ѓcients are separable have been derived and studiedvan den bergh et al  van den bergh  one class consists of metrics ofthe formds  ek+kdt + dx + es+sef +f dy + ef +f Оёwhere k s and f depend on t k s and f depend on x Оё  dz + П‰ dx and П‰depends on t and x some perfect п¬‚uid solutions are known explicitly but usuallyturned out to be selfsimilar with bigbang singularities of the usual types the stiп¬Ђп¬‚uid Оі   is a special case discussed in detail by van den bergh  mostof the solutions have singularities at п¬Ѓnite spatial distances or can be regarded asinhomogeneous perturbations of the bianchi v i modelsthe cases with orthogonal v were classiп¬Ѓed by wainwright  and anumber of speciп¬Ѓc examples are known eg wainwright and goode  kramer a recent solution found by senovilla  attracted much attention because it is nonsingular chinea et al  evading the focussing conditions in thesingularity theorems by containing matter that is too diп¬Ђuseit is closely relatedto an earlier solution of feinstein and senovilla  the metrics investigatedin this class generally have kasnerlike behaviour near the singularity though somehave a planewave asymptotic behaviour wainwright  and become selfsimilaror spatially homogeneous in the far futurefinally we come to the moststudied class those where the generating techniquesare applicable the matter content must have characteristic propagation speeds equalto the speed of light so attention is restricted to vacuum electromagnetic neutrino and stiп¬Ђ п¬‚uid or equivalently massless scalar п¬Ѓeld with a timelike gradientcases however flrw п¬‚uid solutions can be obtained by using the same methods inhigherdimensions and using dimensional reduction there are useful reviews covering the cosmological cylindrical and colliding wave subclasses carmeli et al verdaguer  verdaguer  ferrari  griп¬ѓths  the metrics can bewritten in a form covering also the related stationary axisymmetric metrics asds  З«fabdxadxb + ОґeОіdx  З«dxfwhere a b take values   and the values of fab can be written as a matrixf П‰ f П‰ + З«xf   ff П‰the case Оґ  З«   gives the stationary axisymmetric metrics the case Оґ  З«  the cylindrical cases and З«  Оґ   the cosmological cases physically these classesdiп¬Ђer in the timelike or spacelike nature of the surfaces of symmetry and the natureof the gradient of the determinant of the metric in those surfacessome studies have focussed on the mathematics showing how known vacuum solutions can be related by solutiongenerating techniques kitchingham  whileothers have concentrated on the physics of the evolution and interpretative issuesthe generating techniques use one or more of a battery of related methods backlundtransformation inverse scattering soliton solutions and so on one interesting question that has arisen from recent work is whether solitons in relativity do or do notexhibit nonlinear interactions boyd et al  in investigations of solitons ina bianchi i background found no nonlinearity while belinskii  has claimedthere is a nonlinear eп¬Ђect see also verdaguer the applications in cosmology which have generated far too many papers to listthem all here have been pursued by a number of groups notably by carmeli charachand feinstein by verdaguer and colleagues by gleiser pullin and colleagues andbelinski curir and francaviglia with important contributions by ibanez kitchingham yurtsever ferrari chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos letelier tsoubelis andwang and many othersone use of these metrics is to provide models for universes with gravitationalwavesit emerges that the models studied are typically kasnerlike near the singularity agreeing with the lk arguments and settle down to selfsimilar or spatially homogeneous models with superposed highfrequency gravitational waves atlate times adams et al  carmeli and feinstein  feinstein  another use is to model straight cosmic strings in interaction with gravitational orother waves eg economou and tsoubelis  verdaguer  one canalso examine the gravitational analogue of faraday rotation piran and saп¬Ѓer tomimatsu  wang a and there are even solutions whose exact behaviouragrees precisely with the linearized perturbation calculations for flrw universescarmeli et al  other modelssolutions with less symmetry than those above have been little explored followingkrasinski one can divide the cases considered into a number of classes in which ionly mention a few important special subcases the szekeresszafron family also independently found by tomimura thesehave in general no symmetries and contain an irrotational nonacceleratingп¬‚uid tolmanbondi universes are included in this class as are the kantowskisachs metrics some generalizations are known such as the rotating inhomogeneous model due to stephani  like the g solutions mentioned earliersome szekeres models obey exactly the linearized perturbation equations forthe flrw models goode and wainwright  shearfree irrotational metrics barnes  which include the conformally п¬‚atп¬‚uids stephani a b and mcvitties spherically symmetric metricbona and coll  have recently argued that the stephani cases can onlyhave acceptable thermodynamics if the metrics admit three killing vectors the vaidyapatelkoppar family which represent an flrw model contaning akerr solution using null radiation and an electromagnetic п¬Ѓeld the physicalsigniп¬Ѓcance of these metrics is dubious some other special cases such as olesons petrov type n п¬‚uid solutions syntheses and conclusions what have we learnthere i collect up the outcome of the work surveyed above without repeating alldetails and review some relevant extra references but many interesting aspects arestill omitted for example the literature covers such issues as models for interactionsbetween diп¬Ђerent forms of matter and generation of gravitational radiation the classical singularitythe occurrence of a bigbang in flrw models is not just a consequence of thehigh symmetry its nature in general models is probably a curvature singularity andthe best guess so far is that the asymptotic behaviour would be oscillatory but otherpossibilities exist the penrose conjecture which would be a selection principle onmodels has been particularly developed using exact solutions as examples by wainwright and goode who have given a precise deп¬Ѓnition of the notion of an isotropicsingularity goode et al  tod  occurrence of inп¬‚ationin old inп¬‚ation in bianchi i models inп¬‚ation need not occur barrow and turner but in new inп¬‚ation it was predicted steigman and turner  in a large classof chaotic inп¬‚ation models it is also expected moss and sahni  further papers by a number of authors have suggested that inп¬‚ation need not always occur seerothman and ellis  for some criticisms of earlier papers removal of anisotropy and inhomogeneitythree means of smoothing the universe have been explored over the years the use ofviscosity in the early universe the removal of horizons in the mixmaster universesand removal during inп¬‚ation the п¬Ѓrst two of these ingenious suggestions are due tomisnerattempts to smooth out anisotropies or inhomogeneities by any process obeyingdeterministic sets of diп¬Ђerential equations satisfying lipschitztype conditions aredoomed to fail as was п¬Ѓrst pointed out by collins and stewart  in the contextof viscous mechanisms the argument is simply that one can impose any desiredamount of anisotropy or inhomogeneity now and evolve the system backwards intime to reach initial conditions at some earlier time whose evolution produces thechosen presentday valuesthe same argument also holds for inп¬‚ationary models inп¬‚ation in itself withoutthe use of singular equations or otherwise indeterminate evolutions cannot wholly explain present isotropy or homogeneity although it may reduce deviations by large factors siroussezia  wald  moss and sahni  futamase et al although one can argue that anisotropy tends to prolong inп¬‚ation this does notremove the diп¬ѓcultysince  i have been arguing a heretical view about one of the grounds forinп¬‚ation namely the п¬‚atness problem on the grounds that the formulation of thisproblem makes an implicit and unjustiп¬Ѓed assumption that the a priori probabilitiesof values of П‰ is spread over some range suп¬ѓcient to make the observed closeness to implausible unless one can justify the a priori distribution there is no implausibility ellis however if one accepts there is a п¬‚atness problem then there is also an isotropyproblem since at least for some probability distributions on the inhomogeneity andanisotropy the models would not match observation protagonists of inп¬‚ation cannothave it both ways perhaps if one does not want to just say well thats how theuniverse was born one has to explain the observed smoothness by appeal to thespeculative era as salam  called it ie by appeal to ones favourite theory ofquantum gravityif inп¬‚ation works well at early times then inп¬‚ation actually enhances the chanceof an anisotropic model п¬Ѓtting the data and since the property of anisotropy cannotbe totally destroyed in general because it can be coded into geometric invariantswhich cannot become zero by any classical evolution the anisotropy could reassertitself in the future this of course will not happen if a nonzero О» term persists asthe cosmic nohair theorems show wald  morrowjones and witt the mixmaster horizon removal suggestion was shown to fail when more detailedcomputations than misners were made maccallum  doroshkevich et al chitre  incidentally one may note that inп¬‚ation does not solve the originalform of the horizon problem which was to account completely for the similarity ofpoints on the last scattering surface governed by diп¬Ђerent subsets of the inital datasurface inп¬‚ation leads to a large overlap between these initial data subsets but notto their exact coincidence thus one still has to assume that the nonoverlap regionsare not too diп¬Ђerent while this may give a more plausible model it does not removethe need for assumptions on the initial data the exit from inп¬‚ationa further interesting application of nonstandard models has come in a recent attemptto answer the question posed by ellis and rothman unpublished of how the universecan choose a uniform reference frame at the exit from inп¬‚ation when a truly de sittermodel has no preferred time axis anninos et al a have shown by taking aninп¬‚ating bianchi v model that the answer is that the memory is retained and theuniverse is never really de sitter the helium abundancethis is still used to set limits on anisotropy during the nucleosynthesis phase the cosmic microwave backgroundobservations limit the integrated eп¬Ђect since last scattering note this can in principle permit large but compensating excursions from flrw one intriguing possibilityraised by ellis et al  is that the observed sphere on the last scattering surfacecould lie on a timelike hypercylinder of homogeneity in a static spherically symmetric model this makes the cmwbr isotropic at all points not only at the centreand although it cannot п¬Ѓt all the other data the model shows how careful one mustbe in drawing conclusions about the geometry of the universe from observations notto assume the result one wishes to provethere is a theorem by ehlers geren and sachs  showing that if a congruenceof geodesicallymoving observers all observe an isotropic distribution of collisionlessgas the metric must be robertsonwalker treciokas and ellis  have investigated the related problem with collisions recently ferrando et al  haveinvestigated inhomogeneous models where an isotropic gas distribution is possiblethese studies throw into focus a conjecture which is usually assumed namely that anapproximately isotropic gas distribution at all points would imply an approximatelyrobertsonwalker metric it is this assumption which underlies the arguments normally used in analysing data like that from cobe to get detailed information onallowed flrw perturbations the far futureanisotropy will in general become apparent if it is present and if the cosmologicalconstant О» is zeroisotropy is not stable inhomogeneities may become signiп¬Ѓcanteven faster the origin of structurenone of the work discussed above accounts for the origin of structure although itoп¬Ђers suitable descriptions for the evolution or the background spacetime in whichthe evolution takes place i feel it does however indicate strongly that the true originlies in the perhaps unknowable situation in the speculative era and the resultinginitial conditions for the later evolution a genuinely anisotropic and inhomogeneous universewhile i do not think one can give a deп¬Ѓnitive answer to this question i wouldpersonally be very surprised if anisotropic but homogeneous models turned out tobe anything more than useful examples however the status of fully inhomogeneousmodels is less clearone argument is that while the standard models may be good approximationsat present they are unstable to perturbations both in the past and the future thepossible alternative pasts are quite varied as shown above even without consideringquantum gravity similarly the universe may not be isotropic in the far futuremoreover we have no knowledge of conditions outside our past null cone wheresome inп¬‚ationary scenarios would predict bubbles of diп¬Ђering flrw universes andperhaps domain walls and so onif the universe were flrw or very close to that this means it is in a region in thespace of all possible models which almost any reasonable measure is likely to say hasvery low probability though note the earlier remarks on assignments of probabilitiesone can only evaluate and perhaps explain this feature by considering nonflrwmodels it is noteworthy that many of the problems inп¬‚ation claims to tackle arenot problems if the universe simply is always flrw hence as already argued aboveone has a deep problem in explaining why the universe is in the unlikely flrw stateif one accepts the arguments about probabilities current in work on inп¬‚ationsuppose we speculated that the real universe is signiп¬Ѓcantly inhomogeneous atthe present epoch at a level beyond that arising from perturbations in flrwwhat would the objections be there are only two relevant pieces of data as faras i can see one is the deep galaxy counts made by the automatic plate measuringmachines which are claimed to restrict variations to a few percent and the other isthe isotropy of the cmwbr although the latter is a good test for large lumps ina basically flrw universe one has to question recalling the results of ellis et al whether it really implies

    "text": "introductionthe search for exact solutions in general relativity can usually be dividedin two parts the п¬Ѓrst part which we call kinematical consists in therestriction to a subset of п¬Ѓelds in the space of п¬Ѓeld conп¬Ѓgurations ie in themaking of appropriate ansatzethis restriction is made in accordance with the physical problem in consideration and is achieved by considering only the conп¬Ѓgurations which areinvariant or symmetric under the action of a symmetry group s for example in the case of closed п¬‚at and open friedmannrobertsonwalker cosmological models s is respectively so e  so  and plays the roleof group of spatial homogeneity and isotropyin the second or dynamical part of the search for exact solutions ingeneral relativity we study the equations implied by the original theory inthe set of ssymmetric conп¬Ѓgurations the number of independent variablesin these equations is equal to the dimensionality of spacetime minus thedimensionality of the orbits of the symmetry grouphere we will describe following  a method of п¬Ѓnding invariant metricsand symmetric gauge п¬Ѓelds used in the kinematical part of the search forsolutions of the eym equations see also  invariant metrics and symmetric gauge fieldsconsider a spacetime of the formm  m  sr where s and r are lie groups and assume that we are interested in ssymmetric solutions of the eym equations the gauge group k is assumedto be a compact lie grouplet us for further simplicity restrict ourselves to a homogeneous spacetimem  sr the reader interested in the general case  is referred to the contribution bykapetanakis and zoupanos in the present volume and to the literature notice that the sinvariant ansatz for the metric and the ssymmetric ieinvariant up to a gauge transformation ansatz for the gauge п¬Ѓeld discussedhere are always present in the general casewe п¬Ѓrst chose a prefered moving frame in sr and describe the sinvariant ansatz for the metric in srconsider the canonical s  liesvalued leftinvariant oneform onthe group manifold of sОё  ОёО±tО±  sds where the tО± are the generators of s and ОёО± are leftinvariant oneforms ons the form Оё is very important for the study of the invariant geometryof the lie group s and its pull back to sr plays as we shall see belowan analogous role in the study of the invariant geometry of the coset spacesr the group s can be considered as a principal bundle over sr withstructure group r we assume r to be a closed subgroup of s and sr tobe a reductive coset space let us chose a local section Пѓ of this bundle ina neighborood of the origin o  e  rПѓ  u  sr  sand pull the form Оё back to sr with respect to ПѓОёx  ПѓОёx  ПѓxdПѓx  ОёО±tО± the svalued oneform Оё in  is called the maurercartan oneform in sra local moving coframe can be obtained from the maurer cartan one formas follows lets  r + mbe a reductive decomposition of s where r  lier and m is a reductiveie r m  m complementary subspace andtО±  ta t a  ta  m t a  rbe an adapted basis in s we have the natural decomposition of the maurercartan oneform associated with Оё  Оёm + Оёr  Оёata + Оё at aunlike the group case s the oneforms ОёО± in sr are in general not sinvariant nevertheless they have simple transformation laws under the action of s for given s  s x  u and Пѓ let rsx Пѓ be the element of theisotropy group r deп¬Ѓned byПѓsx  sПѓxrsx Пѓ then the transformation law of Оёa and Оё a under the action of s  s can beeasily obtained fromabs Оёm  ad rs xОёms Оёr  ad rs xОёr + rs xdrsx where ad denotes the adjoint representation of s the reductiveness of thedecomposition  implies that the restriction of ad to the subgroup r hasm as an invariant subspace the representation of r in m obtained in thisway is called the isotropy representation and is denoted by adr let xabe the frame dual to Оёa it is clear from a that under s the vectors xain this frame transform in the same way the ta do under the isotropy actionof rs x let b  be an adrinvariant scalar product inm with components bab  bta tb then we conclude  that the metricin sr with the same components bab in the frame xas x ie ad rОі  bab Оёa  Оёbis sinvariant moreover any sinvariant metric in sr can be constructedin this way therefore we have succeded in reducing the diп¬Ђerential geometry problem of п¬Ѓnding sinvariant metrics in the coset space sr to thepurely algebraic problem of п¬Ѓnding adrinvariant scalar products in m theequation  with bab being an adrinvariant scalar product in m gives theansatz for sinvariant metrics in srin an analogous way  the problem of п¬Ѓnding ssymmetric gauge п¬Ѓeldswith gauge group k in sr is reduced by wangs theorem  to the algebraicproblem of intertwining equivalent representations of the isotropy group tosee this recall that according to wangs theorem the most general form ofa ssymmetric gauge п¬Ѓeld in sr is given bywherea  О»Оёr + О»Оёm О»  r  k  liekais an homomorphism from the isotropy algebra r to the lie algebra of thegauge group k and О» is a mapping from m to kО»  m  kbsatisfying the linear propertyО»adru  adО»rО»u u  m r  rcthis property means that the mapp О» intertwines the representation of rin m ie the isotropy representation with the representation of О»r ink obtained by restricting the adjoint representation of k to О»r thesolutions of c are therefore given by schurs

    "text": "introductionfrom time to time i amuse myself by mentally assembling a list of articles i wouldlike to have written the candidates for this list have to satisfy a number of criterianaturally they have to be both important and interesting to me equally they haveto contain results that i can convince myself however unreasonably that i couldhave obtained every time i make my list i am struck again by the number ofarticles by dieter brill appearing on it at п¬Ѓrst glance this is explained by the largeoverlap between our interests in reality however the explanation is to be found byconsidering the kind of article that dieter has written over the years and the way inwhich he manages to convey major insights in a deceptively simple fashion in thiswork i wish to return to an article that has a permanent place on my list the famousbrill waves and show how some of the the earliest work that dieter did in generalrelativity continues to oп¬Ђer valuable insight a third of a century later brillin his thesis brill  dieter brill considered axisymmetric momentoftimesymmetry vacuum initial data for the einstein equationsthe starting point is anaxially symmetric

fairly rapidly atinп¬Ѓnity faster than r and that it be reasonably diп¬Ђerentiablethis metric g is to be conformally transformed to a metric g  П†g so that the metricg has vanishing scalar curvature so as to satisfy the momentoftimesymmetry initialvalue constraint of the einstein equations this is equivalent to seeking a positivesolution П† togП†  rП†   П†   П†   at where r is the scalar

the sobolev inequality statesthat for any asymptotically п¬‚at riemannian threemanifold there exists a positiveconstant sg such thatz f dv  sgz f dvwhere the integral on the right hand side of  is

approaches zero both Оё itself and the surface integral of Оё remain wellbehavedin particular the r part of Оё does not vanish in the limit therefore the surfaceintegral remains bounded away from zero this means that the volume integral in must blow up like y since Оё remains п¬Ѓnite П† must become unboundedlylarge in other words П† must blow up like yit is not enough that П† blow up like a delta function at one point it must becomelarge on an extended region so that the integral r ОёП†dv blows up like y howeverwe know that П† is not a random object it satisп¬Ѓes a diп¬Ђerential equation which forcesa broad blowup on П† we can make this more precise by returning to eqn usingthe fact that that one has to distribute on the shell to give the speciп¬Ѓed potential distribution ifthe potential is everywhere positive on the shell the charge must be positiveif the shell were conducting the potential on it would be constant now we can talkabout the capacitance c the constant ratio between the charge m and the potentialon the surface the capacitance is a kind of harnack constant because we havec minОґbc maxОґbОѕ  mОѕ  mthese are easy to derive replacing a nonconstant potential on Оґb by its minimummaximum value must decrease increase the charge while the decreased increasedcharge equals the capacitance multiplied by the potential since the capacitancedepends only on the size and shape of the surface not on the charge we immediatelysee that as minОґb Оѕ or minОґb П† increases  so will the adm mass if we incorporate  and  together we can see that the mass grows linearly with П† moreprecisely we havecwhere q is the quadrupole moment now we getdП†П† + rthe positive parts he threw away the positive parts and considered only a negativepotential he even further simpliп¬Ѓed the problem and considered the problem ofscattering oп¬Ђ a negative spherical square well potential he wrote down an analyticsolution to this problemwheeler considered a spherically symmetric square well potential in п¬‚at space ieit is easy to solvethe solution isu  bu  r  ar  aП€  uП€  П€   at П€ the scattering state blows up and ceases to exist if the well is made even deeperthe scattering solution reappears but now it is no longer everywhere positive it hasa node this pattern repeats itself as the energy of the next lowest energy stateapproaches zero and so onthe r part of the scattering solution also blows up as one approaches the criticalpoint if one approaches the critical point from the other side where the scatteringsolution has a node the coeп¬ѓcient of the r term approaches  this now allowsone to give a fairly nonsensical answer to a fairly unreasonable question what is theenergy of a closed universe my answer is zero the average of + and we now have a fairly precise understanding of what happens as we pump up oneof the brill waves the yamabe constant approaches zero for some п¬Ѓnite value ofthe parameter a the mass approaches + and an apparent horizon appears whichmoves out towards inп¬Ѓnity the horizon as it moves outwards becomes more andmore spherical the breakdown of the system coincides with the horizon reachingspacelike inп¬Ѓnity at the critical point we get data which gives us a smooth compactmanifold without boundary with zero scalar curvaturei would like to point out here that we have less understanding of what happens aswe further increase the factor a our only real guide is the wheeler model if this isvalid the mass should drop to  just on the other side we would have initial datawith a naked singularity the mass would build up again until it became positiveand then blow up to + as the eigenvalue of the п¬Ѓrst excited state approached zeroand so on it would be nice to prove that this is or is not the correct picturethe analysis given in section  only deals with the situation when the yamabeconstant is close to zero does it hold in general in particular if one takes abrill wave and increase the constant does the mass increase monotonically does theyamabe constant decrease monotonically these are questions that are yet to beansweredan even more fundamental question what happens as one approaches the boundaryof conformal superspace along a diп¬Ђerent direction ie not by holding q п¬Ѓxed andincreasing a but by changing q i am unable to answer this question deп¬Ѓnitively alli can say is that it is currently being investigated by numerical techniques abrahams heiderich shapiro and teukolskybrill waves have been used by the numerical relativity community from its earliestdays eg eppley  and this use has continued right up to the present thestandard approach pioneered by eppley is to choose a metric of the form  withq chosen to be some analytic function equation  is then solved numerically to п¬Ѓndthe conformal factor П† finally the physical metric g  П†g is constructed eppleyshowed numerically that the overall structure described in the previous sections holdstrue with a small scale factor a equation  can be solved as a increases theconformal factor increases in the middle eventually a minimal surface an apparenthorizon appears in the physical space finally at some п¬Ѓnite value of a the solutionto  blows uprecently abrahams heiderich shapiro and teukolsky  showed that this picture of conformal superspace was grossly oversimpliп¬Ѓed they chose as q the functionПЃq  ПЃ expwithnow i conformally transform g О»  ПЃexpПЃ + О»zq О» by dividing it by О» to п¬Ѓnally getО»  ecqg О»dПЃ + dz + ПЃdОёthis combination of coordinate and conformal transformations cannot change thevalue of the yamabe constant this means that we can still solve  for each g О»however the value of the adm mass is not a conformal invariant it picks up a factorО» thus the new mass instead of remaining constant blows up as О»  when one looks at q О» eqn it is clear that the limiting metric is no longersingular however it is still unpleasant as it is no longer asymptotically п¬‚at thez dependence in q  drops out and the metric becomes cylindrically symmetric ratherthan axially symmetricthe adm mass is measured with respect to some unit meters lightyears whatever this combination of coordinate transformation together with a conformaltransformation can be regarded as the equivalent of a change of units and the valueof the adm mass will change appropriately thus any relationship between the massand the yamabe constant can only be valid in some very restrictive sense one has toп¬Ѓx the unitslet me return to the other feature that ahst observed the absence of apparenthorizonsit does not matter whether one performs this combination of constantcoordinate and conformal transformations on the base space or on the physical spaceapparent horizons at momentoftimesymmetry are equivalent to minimal surfacesminimal surfaces are stable under constant scalings therefore if ahst п¬Ѓnd noapparent horizons neither will i even though the mass blows up for the sequence iconsider this does not contradict the analysis in section  in that section i assumedthe existence of an external region where the physical geometry was dominated bythe conformal factor in the sequence of metrics considered here the support of thebase scalar curvature spreads ever outwards preventing us from taking advantage ofthe increase of mit is not even clear what happens to the yamabe constant in the limit О»   all ican say is that it will not pass through zero at any п¬Ѓnite value of О» there is a hintin wheelers spherically symmetric toy model that the yamabe constant may remainnonzero even in the limitlet us return to but instead of considering a sequence in which b a approachesПЂ let us increase a and simultaneously scale down b so that b a remains constantequal to say ПЂ now the coeп¬ѓcient of the r term becomes unboundedly largeit scales with a however the value of П€ itself never becomes large we п¬Ѓnd П€  п¬Ѓnd metrics which are not asymptotically п¬‚at metrics which are not smooth metricswhich are not uniformly elliptic and metrics for which the yamabe constant equalszerowhat understanding we have of such issues as the size and shape of conformalsuperspace has basically been gained by looking closely at the brill wavesi amconvinced that yet more information can and will be extracted from them in myintroduction i stated that they oп¬Ђer valuable insight a third of a

    "text": "introduction of an environment alter theintrinsically chaotic or nonchaotic character in the dynamics of a system ischaotic behavior likely to be enhanced or quenched some aspects of thisproblem have been studies as chaos in systems with noise  usually ifthe systems nonlinear dynamics shows chaotic behavior the presence ofan environment which adds a stochastic force is expected to modify thechaotic behavior only quantitativelyif the coupling of the system withthe environment is strong and nonlinear qualitative changes in the systemsdynamics are likely although structures and forms are usually discussed inthe context of classical dissipative systems it would be very gratifying if onecan understand the rules from which such macroscopic structures  in theclassical world emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a quantum system    nonlinear dissipative dynamics in a quantum open systemmay play an important role in this issuean indirect and perhaps conceptually more subtle problem is the following if we view classical behavior as a macroscopic phenomenon emergentfrom a quantum open system will it provide us with some insight to resolvethe apparent puzzle that there are chaotic behavior in the classical equationof motion but usually not in the associated quantum equation of motion isit easier to account for nonintegrability in an eп¬Ђective theory than a fundamental theory in the viewpoint we presented above while a quantum closedsystem is completely describable by a fundamental theory vis quantum mechanics the corresponding classical theory is only an eп¬Ђective theory in thesense that it has incorporated the backreaction eп¬Ђect of the environment which is subjected to coarsegraining approximations in such a process usually a simple dynamical equation is transformed into an integrodiп¬Ђerentialequation of motion thus classical dynamics is a limiting form of an eп¬Ђective quantum theory one can study how under these statistical procedurescoarsegraining decoherence and backreaction an integrable quantum system becomes a classical chaotic system conversely a more diп¬ѓcult problemis to take a classical model which exhibits chaotic behavior and determineif it can be obtained through certain reduction schemes as the macroscopiclimit of an associated set of integrable quantum models this is of course amanytoone relation depending on the choice of schemes the nonintegrability of the classical system could then be seen as an outcome both of theoriginal quantum dynamics and the quantum to classical reduction scheme

    "text": "introduction  the present state of the universeformed as a result of growth of small initial primordial perturbations inorder to produce the observed inhomogeneities the initial perturbations musthave had the speciп¬Ѓc amplitude and speciп¬Ѓc spectrum there are sometheoretical and observational arguments in support of the socalled п¬‚atharrisonzeldovich spectrum  of the initial п¬‚uctuationsin order to becompatible with the observations this picture may also require a signiп¬Ѓcantamount of dark matterthe dynamical characteristics of the averaged distribution of the matterthe growth and formation of the small scale inhomogeneities the abundancesof various chemical elements as well as other features of the actual universeare all successfully brought together by the standard classical cosmological theory the trouble is however that the standard theory postulatescertain properties of the universe rather than derives them from more fundamental principles for instance the observational fact of the angular uniformity of the temperature of the microwave background radiation over the skydoes not have any rational explanation except of being a consequence of thepostulated everlasting homogeneity and isotropy plus small perturbationsa more natural explanation to a set of observational facts can be provided bythe inп¬‚ationary hypothesis  of course this hypothesis has its own limitsof applicability and conditions of realization and after all it may prove to bewrong but the phenomenon of inп¬‚ation seems to be quite general and stablethis is why it is worthwhile to investigate its consequences and compare withobservationsaccording to the inп¬‚ationary hypothesis the spatial volume of the universe conп¬Ѓned to the current hubble distance lh  ch    cm orpossibly even much larger volume has developed from a small region whichwas causally connected in the very distant pastif the inп¬‚ationary stagein the evolution of the very early universe did really take place the largescale homogeneity and isotropy as well as the closeness of П‰ to one can beexplained as the consequences of the inп¬‚ationary expansionthe simplest model for the inп¬‚ationary stage of expansion is provided bythe desitter solution originally it was derived as a solution to the vacuumeinstein equations with a constant cosmological О»term however it canalso be treated as a solution to the einstein equations with matter satisfyingthe eп¬Ђective equation of state p  З« the desitter solution describes aspacetime with a constant curvature this spacetime is as symmetricas minkowski spacetime in the sense that it also admits the parametergroup of motions the line element of the desitter spacetime has the formsee for example ds  cdt  athdr + sinrciddОё + sinОёdП€cidiwhere at  rch ctassumption just postpones the answer to the above mentioned questions andreturns us to the problem of cosmological singularity and quantum gravityas a more fundamental solution to the problem it was suggested  thatthe inп¬‚ationary era was preceded by an essentially quantumgravitationalphenomenon called a spontaneous birth of the universe a theory capableof describing the classical stages of evolution of the universe as well as itsquantumgravitational origin can be named a complete cosmological theorylet us speculate on the main expected features of such a theorythe desired evolution of the scale factor at is shown in fig  according to this scenario the moment of appearance of the classical universecorresponded to t   after that moment of time the inп¬‚ationary evolutionhas started and has been governed by eq  it is natural to expect that allthe characteristic parameters of the newly born universe were of order of theplanckian scales ie the classical spacetime came into being near the limitof applicability of classical general relativity the inп¬‚ationary expansion maybe able to pickup such a microuniverse and to increase its size up at least tothe present day hubble radius the wiggly line joining the points a   anda  lpl at fig  was meant to describe an essentially quantumgravitationalprocess similar to the quantum tunnelling or quantum decay which couldhave resulted in the nucleation of the universe in the state of classical desitter expansion it is reasonable to suppose that at the beginning of classicalevolution the deviations from the highly symmetric desitter solution werenegligibly small moreover it seems to be suп¬ѓcient to take these deviationswith the minimally possible amplitude ie at the level of quantum zeropoint п¬‚uctuations during the inп¬‚ationary period these п¬‚uctuations couldhave been ampliп¬Ѓed and produce the density perturbations and gravitationalwaves the density perturbations are needed to form the observed inhomogeneities in the universe gravitational waves seem to be the only source ofimpartial information about the inп¬‚ationary epoch and the quantum birthof the universethese matters have been subjects of study in many research papers byvarious authors we will discuss them in more detail below we will see thatsome of the notions introduced above have acquired more precise formulationand some of the problems have been partially solved an overview of quantum eп¬Ђects in cosmologythat quantum eп¬Ђects and quantum concepts should play a decisive role indiп¬Ђerent contexts and at diп¬Ђerent levels of approximation it is useful to givea short classiп¬Ѓcation of the areas of further discussion where the quantumnotions will be dealt with it is worth emphasizing that we will often usebelow the common and powerful technique which is the splitting up of a givenproblem into the background and perturbational partswe will start from a description of classical perturbations on a classicalbackground spacetime the physical meaning of such eп¬Ђects as parametricampliп¬Ѓcation of cosmological perturbations and п¬Ѓrst of all ampliп¬Ѓcation ofgravitational waves can be clearly seen already at this level of approximation the next level of approximation treats the perturbations as quantizedп¬Ѓelds interacting with the variable gravitational п¬Ѓeld of the nonstationaryuniverse or in geometrical language with the classical background geometry a particular but not obligatory example of the variable gravitationalп¬Ѓeld is provided by the inп¬‚ationary expansion at this level of approximation we will see how the initial vacuum state of the quantized п¬Ѓelds evolvesinto a pure multiparticle state with very speciп¬Ѓc quantum properties it willbe shown that the п¬Ѓnal quantum state belongs to the class of the socalledsqueezed quantum states squeezing is a very distinct feature potentially allowing to prove or disprove the quantum origin of the primordial cosmologicalperturbationsat a still deeper level the background geometry and matter п¬Ѓelds are alsotreated quantummechanically  this is the realm of quantum cosmologythe main object of interest in quantum cosmology is the wave function ofthe universe which in general describes all degrees of freedom at the equalfooting this level of discussion is appropriate for tackling such issues asthe beginning and the end of classical evolution as well as quantum birth ofthe universe however there is no one unique wave function of the universethere are many of them all possible wave functions constitute the wholespace of the wave functions presently we do not know any guiding principleallowing to prefer one cosmological wave function over others this is whywe are facing a painful job of analyzing all of them trying to introduce aprobability measure in the space of all wave functionsgoing still further one can introduce a notion of a wave function givenin the space of all possible wave functions in other words a wave functionof the universe becomes an operator acting on the wave function describingthe many universes system this is a subject of the now popular socalledthirdquantized theoryit is aimed at describing the multiple productionand annihilation of the babyuniverses this fascinating subject is still atthe beginning of its development and is beyond the scope of the presentpapers the reader is referred to the recent review and technical papers onthe subject in some sense the diп¬Ђerent theories listed from above tothe bottom are various approximation to the theories listed in the oppositedirectionlet us start from the classical theory of small perturbations superimposedon a given background spacetime parametric superadiabatic

п¬‚uctuations obeying similarequationsthe initial amplitudes and spectrum of classical waves can be arbitraryit is only important to have a nonzero initial amplitude otherwise the п¬Ѓnal amplitude will also be zero now remaining at the same classical levelwe will imitate the quantum zeropoint п¬‚uctuations by assuming that theyare classical waves with certain amplitudes and arbitrary phases waveswith diп¬Ђerent frequencies have diп¬Ђerent amplitudes so they form some initial vacuum spectrum in order to derive the vacuum spectrum we neglectthe interaction with the gravitational п¬Ѓeld and consider essentially wavesin minkowski spacetime the energy density of gravitational waves scalesas З«g  cghО» for a given wavelength О» we want to have a halfof the quantum in each mode that is we

one normally considers closed sphere geometries k  +or toruslike geometries k in order to avoid inп¬Ѓnities arising because ofspatial integration the total energy of a closed world is zero this is whythe analog of the schrodinger equation takes the form Л†hП€   which is thewheeler  dewitt equationfor a frw universe п¬Ѓlled with a scalar п¬Ѓeld П† v П†  where the function f П†  as a consequence

ОёdОёdОІОёПЂОІПЂof course the measure is just the riemannian volume element with respectto the standard round metric on the sphereit should be mentioned that the well known hartlehawking wavefunction  is exactly the south pole Оё  ПЂ of the sphere this wavefunctionis real another real wavefunction corresponds to the north pole of the sphere we call this wavefunction antihartlehawking wavefunction allother wavefunctions are complex on the probability of quantum tunneling from nothingof d is always much less than unity d for wave functions describingquantum tunneling or decay one can deп¬Ѓne a similar quantity d in ourquantum cosmological model though the physical interpretation of d isless clear the main diп¬Ђerence is that in ordinary quantum mechanics oneimposes suitable boundary conditions in time t and space x while in ourproblem there is only one coordinate a the notion of the break of classicalevolution in quantum cosmology is rather delicate we have argued in ref that only in superspaces of more than one dimension this notion canbe clearly formulated nevertheless we will adopt the same deп¬Ѓnition of din our problem d  cidcidcidcidП€ equal to expcid functions however if a cosmological wave function is chosen the derivationof the probability distribution of the permitted classical solutions seems tobe more straightforwarda wave function which has received much attention in the literature is thehartlehawking wave function П€hh  as we have seen above one cannot saythat the П€hh is in any sense more probable than others on the contraryit looks rather as an exception for simple quantum cosmological modelsallowing inп¬‚ation the hartlehawking wave function corresponds to a singlepoint  a pole on the twosphere representing the space of all physicallydiп¬Ђerent wave functions see sec  however the П€hh is a real wave functionwhile all others except the one corresponding to the opposite pole whichis also real and which we call the antihartlehawking wave function arecomplex this exceptional property of the П€hh alone if for no other reasonsjustiп¬Ѓes special attention to this wave function and makes it interesting tosee what kind of predictions with regard to inп¬‚ation follow from itfor the case of homogeneous isotropic models with the scale factor atand a scalar п¬Ѓeld П†t the П€hh predicts a set of classical inп¬‚ationary solutions which can be described as trajectories in the twodimensional spaceat П†t see  and sec  these trajectories begin in the vicinityof a line which is the caustic line for the socalled euclidean trajectoriesthe probability distribution phh for the classical lorentzian inп¬‚ationarysolutions follows from the П€hh and has the formphh  n expof return from which the second branch of the caustic line develops seefig   the point of return on the caustic line divides the euclideantrajectories into two families which touch the п¬Ѓrst or the second branch ofthe caustic respectively the lorentzian inп¬‚ationary solutions cannot beginwith the initial value of the scalar п¬Ѓeld and the hubble factor lower than thevalue corresponding to the point of return П† and therefore their periods ofinп¬‚ation cannot be arbitrarily short thus П€hh gives more weight to inп¬‚ationary solutions with lower initial values of П†t but does not accommodatesolutions which begin with П†t smaller than П† the numerical estimatesfor the case of the scalar п¬Ѓeld potentials v П†  mП† and v П†  О»П†show  that the number П† falls short a factor  or  respectively to ensurethe minimally suп¬ѓcient inп¬‚ation the inп¬‚ated scale turns out to be of order cm instead of the required  cm at the same time the probabilitydistribution function phh reaches its maximum value at П†  П† thus itseems that the most probable prediction of the hartlehawking wave function is a small underinп¬‚ated universe however it is possible that thediscrepancy between lh and the predicted inп¬‚ated scale may be weakenedor even removed for other scalar п¬Ѓeld potentials apart from that the deп¬Ѓciency of П† in being just a numerical factor  or  smaller than necessaryin the situation where the initial values of the scalar п¬Ѓeld can vary within ahuge interval from П† up to about  П† can serve as an indication that theduration of inп¬‚ation close to the minimally suп¬ѓcient amount should probably be taken seriously at least as a prediction of the hartlehawking wavefunctionthe meaning of the above discussion is that the search for the remnantsof the preinп¬‚ationary universe in the framework of the inп¬‚ationary hypothesis may not necessarily be of a purely academic interest relic gravitons and the birth of the universeequation for the linearized perturbationslet us consider a closed universe governed by an eп¬Ђective cosmologicalterm О» and perturbed by weak gravitational waves the wd equation forthe wave function of this system can be written in the form see for exampleref  considering now the case k  + however eq  has in fact a widerdomain of applicability the assumptions under which eq  was derivedretain this equation valid in the region where aa describes a classicallyforbidden behaviour of the universe ie this equation is valid in the underbarrier region ah see fig  as wellin this region eq  takesthe form of the schrodinger equation written in the imaginary time thusthe graviton wave function П€ah extends to the classically forbidden regionah and may be sensitive to the form of the background wave function inthis regionour п¬Ѓnal goal is to show that the initial quantum state of gravitons atthe beginning of the desitter stage before the parametric ampliп¬Ѓcation hasstarted is not unrelated to the form of the background wave function of theuniverse in the region ah everywhere in our previous discussion wewere assuming that the initial state of gravitons at О·  О·b was the vacuumthe presentday observational predictions have also been derived under thisassumption however this assumption though quite usual and natural isnot obligatory if the initial state of gravitons could have been a nonvacuumstate then it would lead to the diп¬Ђering predictions for the present dayspectrum of relic gravitons and their squeeze parametersin this way bymeasuring the actual parameters of relic gravitons one could learn somethingabout the wave function of the universe in its classically forbidden regimeone should note however that the possible deviations of the initial quantum state of gravitons from the vacuum state regardless of the origin ofthese deviations can not be too large these deviations should satisfy tworequirements first they should not violate our basic assumption that thebackaction of gravitons on the background geometry is always negligiblysmall second they should not lead to the predictions for the present dayamplitudes which would exceed the existing experimental limits by combining these requirements one can show that only for lowfrequency waves andonly for cosmological models with minimally suп¬ѓcient duration of inп¬‚ationthe initial quantum state of graviton modes can possibly deviate from thevacuum  in this case the deviations of the presentday spectrum can beas large as is shown by the broken line in fig  for a speciп¬Ѓc desittermodel with l  ch   lplin this п¬Ѓgure the dotted line shows thespectrum produced from the initial vacuum state in the same model and thesolid line shows the highest possible inп¬‚ationary spectrum compatible withthe observational limits the solid line is just a low frequency part of theinп¬‚ationary spectrum presented in fig now we return to the question of which of the background wave functionsare compatable with the deviations of the initial quantum state of gravitonsfrom the vacuum as we have already seen the hartlehawking wave function П€hh and the antihartlehawking wave function П€ahh are in a sensetwo extremes in the description of the classically forbidden domain each ofthese extremes can be used in eq  as a background wave function foreach of them the solution to eq  can be presented in the gaussian formcompare with eq  П€h О·

    "text": "introductionthe occurrence of close encounters between galaxies has recently been recognized by means of nbody simulations as a possible mechanism for triggering bars in spiral discs byrd

density relation see e gthe recent review of whitmore  but the morphological subtype population of the barred spirals did not appear to depend on the environmentfurthermore in the binary sample the barred and unbarred spirals were foundto have a similar subtype populationin order to search for possible correlations between the presence of abar in a galaxy and its environment eeb examined several catalogues ofgalaxies pertaining to diп¬Ђerent environments the samples of binary galaxiesconstructed by turner  and peterson  the galaxy group samplesidentiп¬Ѓed by turner and gott  and by geller and hucra  a п¬Ѓeldsample taken from turner and gott  and the whole rc catalog whichwas taken as a general reference sample taking the hubble morphologicaltypes and the bar types for each sample from the rc and the ugc catalogues eeb noted an excess of barred earlytype sa sb spirals in the twobinary samples with respect to the other galaxy samples this is at variancewith the п¬Ѓndings of the japanese authors eeb also reported an excess ofearlytype spirals in galaxy pairs for barred spirals and realized that intrinsically fainter and smaller binary members tend to be more frequently barredthan brighter and larger ones nevertheless the statistical signiп¬Ѓcance ofthese interesting claims appears to be rather low in general it is between and  sigmathe availability of numerous new galaxy type classiп¬Ѓcations compiled inthe new rc catalogue de vaucouleurs et al  the fairly low statisticalsigniп¬Ѓcance of the abovementioned main statistical results and above all thefairly vague characterization of the various galaxy samples compared namelythe absence of a welldeп¬Ѓned assessment of the environmental density haveprompted us to rediscuss this matter in  we present the galaxy samplethat we have chosen as our galaxy reference sample i e the nbg cataloguetully a in  we discuss some suitable parameters which can be takenas indicators of the local density of galaxies for each galaxy of the sampleconsidered in  we compare the distribution functions of the various parameters of local density for subsets of spirals of diп¬Ђerent morphological andbar types we also explore the environmental eп¬Ђects on the presence of innerrings which are often associated with bars in spirals in  we summarizeour main results they indicate that the lowluminosity spirals characterizedby high local density tend to be both barred and earlytype thus providinga meaningful statistically strong conп¬Ѓrmation of eebs suggestions takinginto account the relevant nbody simulations of the eп¬Ђects

xiПЃi tully b chose a smoothing constant of Пѓ  mpc for the values of ПЃtabulated in his nbg catalogue so an isolated galaxy with mb  had a local density of ПЃ   galaxies mpc just because of its presencewhereas at the other extreme in the core of virgo cluster the local densityПЃ reached the value of   galaxies mpc a smoothing constant of Пѓ mpc was chosen for plotting the contours of surface density of galaxies onthe maps of the nbg atlas tully and fisher  Пѓ  mpc was usedfor the nearest galaxiesthe abovementioned deп¬Ѓnition of ПЃi implies a fairly small dynamicalrange for the local density ПЃ of the nbg galaxies especially when Пѓ  mpc it could be more convenient and more general to try to use a smoothingfunction which diverges for ri   in order to enhance the local density ПЃof the galaxies which have close companions to obtain this we replace eq with the following more general expressioncО±ПЃiО±Пѓ many nbg galaxies as recorded in the nbg based on the adopted distances and

infig  tend to stay mainly on the relations which go up to the largest ПЃvalues in other words the members of clusters tend to be characterized bylarge ПЃ values whenever large Пѓ values Пѓ   mpc are

that the distances andmean distances of the somewhat farther companions better correlate withthe values of ПЃПѓ relative to the fairly large Пѓ values results barred spiralstable  lists the number of

to counting separately the es earlytype sasb spirals and latetype sbcsm spirals we realize that the density eп¬Ђectis substantially due to the presence of earlytype galaxy neighbours esand earlytype

a matter of fact within the earlytype spirals sasab the barredspirals have on average smaller distances from the nearest neighbours thanthe unbarred ones see fig  and table  furthermore from the distributions of the morphology t of the nearest neighbour we infer that the barredearlytype spirals tend to have galaxies of an earlier type as companions ifcompared to the unbarred ones see fig  and table  this is consistentwith our previous п¬Ѓndingswhen we divide our earlytype spirals into objects intrinsically brighteror fainter than mb we п¬Ѓnd that the local density segregation betweenbarred

spirals into three intervals oflocal density ПЃ     ПЃ   ПЃ   galaxies mpcwe have examined whether the morphological type distributions of each ofthe three bar types are diп¬Ђerent in the three

lowering the upper limit of  galaxies mpc to  does notsigniп¬Ѓcantly change the results we have found that the morphological typedistribution of the sb galaxies associated with the highest density range issigniп¬Ѓcantly shifted at a level of  sigma to morphological types earlierthan the sb located in the lower density regions see fig  and table whereas no morphological type shift as a function of the local densityis observed for the sa and sab types finally we have noted a similarbehaviour using other ПЃПѓ parameters for instance for ПЃ taking as binlimits  and  galaxies mpc the sb galaxies in the densest zones showa  sigma excess of early type spirals whereas for the sa and sab galaxiesthe distributions of morphological type are substantially constant for thevarious density regions ringed spiralsthe occurrence of rings in galaxies generally distinguished into nuclear innerand outer rings is observed to be frequently associated with the presence ofbars see e g the review of buta  on the observational properties ofrings here we shall consider only the inner rings which are more widelypresent and more easily discernible than the other two types of rings in thiscase barred and unbarred galaxies are taken together the presence of innerrings deп¬Ѓnes the socalled sr variety of the standard galaxy classiп¬Ѓcationadopted in the rc and rc catalogues various dynamical mechanismshave been advanced to explain the formation of inner and nuclear as wellrings viscous torques outп¬‚owing winds thermally driven by violent starformation rates gravitational torques and lindblad resonances requiringnonaxisymmetric potentials which are thought to be mostly due to bars ortidal interactions see e g the review of combes  on the theoreticalaspects of ring formation lastly zaspel  stressed that ring structurescan arise in a gas or stellar disk without assuming the initial presence of abar or oval distorsion this would explain the existence of some disk galaxieswith deп¬Ѓnite ring structures but very weak if any bar features as observedby buta a bif ringlike features are often triggered during a tidal interaction asis shown in some nbody simulations combes dupraz and gerin combes  we expect to п¬Ѓnd an overabundance of ringed systems srspirals located in highdensity regions with respect to the pure spiral sshaped ss systemstable  contains the number of nbg spirals within a distance of  mpcbinned by hubble morphological type and ring type sr srs ss comparing the distribution functions of the parameters ПЃПѓ for Пѓ   and  mpc for the various subsets of galaxies we have found no signiп¬Ѓcantdensity segregation between sr or sr+srs and ss spirals either forthe whole spiral sequence or for the early types alone see fig  we havechecked that the weak diп¬Ђerence between the distributions shown in this п¬Ѓgure is not statistically signiп¬Ѓcant  sigma the subdivision of our srsrs ss galaxies into highluminosity and lowluminosity objects withmb   as a limit always conп¬Ѓrms this negative result we concludethat tidal interactions probably play a minor role if any in the formationof inner rings compared to the other mechanisms mentioned above nevertheless we are aware that the categorization of spirals into the sr srsand ss varieties is less secure than the bar type classiп¬Ѓcation and that independent observers are often not very consistent about this subtle aspect ofgalaxy structure discussions and conclusionsemploying a variety of parameters for local galaxy density we have found asigniп¬Ѓcant excess of barred galaxies in the highdensity regions on scales ofa few tenths of mpc of our nearby universe for the earlytype sa sab andrelatively faint mb   spirals together with an overabundance of earlytype spirals in the subset of the barred systems which reside in denser regionsthus spiral galaxies which inhabit dense regions on scales of  mpctend to be barred if they are of early type and tend to be of early type if theyare barred consequently the extension of the canonical morphologydensityrelation to the spiral sequence  according to which earlytype spirals tendto reside in denser regions than latetype objects e g giuricin et al tully b  appears to hold for the barred family alone our п¬Ѓndingsprovide a meaningful statistically strong conп¬Ѓrmation of the recent similaralbeit weaker results of eeb which however lack good criteria for thedeп¬Ѓnition of the local density of galaxiesthe fact that the density segregation that we have found is seen essentially in lowluminosity spirals can be easily explained as follows as a matterof fact several nbody simulations concur that interactions stimulate or considerably accelerate the formation of a bar in a galaxy particularly in thecase of a more massive companion noguchi  gerin et al  salo  i e especially for faint galaxies on average besides interactioninduced bar formation is theoretically expected to be easier in galaxy modelswhich have rising rotation curves up to a large fraction of the galaxy opticaldisk radius  as in lowluminosity spirals see e g persic and salucci  than in models which have rotation curves which rise up to a small fraction of the disk and become п¬‚at thereafter  as in highluminosity spiralsin the latter galaxy models the preferred outcome of an interaction appearsto be an increase in the rate of disruptive collisions between highvelocityinterstellar gas clouds with consequent enhanced star formation especiallyin the central galactic region without a formation of strong longlived barsolson and kwan nevertheless on the basis of the available numerical simulations it isnot easy to understand why galaxy interactions promote bar formation primarly in earlytype spirals we speculate that this diп¬Ђerent behaviour ofearly and latetype spirals can be related to the fact that the bars in earlytypes have basically diп¬Ђerent photometric and kinematic properties beinggenerally stronger and longer than those in late types probably endingnear diп¬Ђerent orbital resonances see e g elmegreen and elmegreen in order to account for this diп¬Ђerent behavioure eeb appear to prefer ascenario in which close encounters of galaxies are supposed to induce bothbar formation in a galaxy and a simultaneous shift of its morphological typetowards early types the latter eп¬Ђect could be caused by interactioninducedinп¬‚ow of stellar and gaseous mass  which is found in the nbody simulations of byrd et al  and byrd sundelius valtonen  this inп¬‚owwould increase the stellar and gas density in the inner regions besides inthe case of prolonged interactions the inп¬‚ow of the gaseous dissipative component would deplete the outer disk of gas and lower the star formationrate in the outer regions these changes would correspond to an alterationof the galaxy morphology towards earlier types within this scenario themorphologydensity relation in the spiral sequence would be mostly due tointeractioninduced evolutionary processes rather than to densitydependentprocesses of galaxy formation the recent nbody simulations of noguchi and salo  conп¬Ѓrm that tidally induced stellar bar structures areable to drive an eп¬ѓcient infall of the gas component in the disk to the nuclear region this infall would trigger nuclear activity in interacting galaxiessee e g the review of heckman  but they also п¬Ѓnd no appreciable corresponding largescale infall of the nondissipative stellar componenthowever a gas infall would give rise to star formation and if this process issuп¬ѓciently fast and eп¬ѓcient it could lead to an increase of the stellar component of the bulge as a consequence the bulges of barred early types wouldtend to appear somewhat bluer than the unbarred ones a fact which has notbeen observed yet in conclusion interactioninduced changes in the galacticmorphological type do not appear to be well documented by the most recentnbody simulationsalternatively our observational results could be framed in a view whichdoes not involve any interactioninduced alteration of the galactic morphology unfortunately the basic galaxy structural parameters which are generally varied in the available simulations such as the disctohalo mass ratioand the degree of central concentration of the halo mass do not describeproperly spiral galaxies of diп¬Ђerent morphological types therefore the eп¬Ђectof interactions on bar triggering as a function of morphological type can notbe inferred nevertheless we could envisage a scenario in which interactionsare able to trigger prominent bar structures essentially in early types besides the excess of early types in barred systems associated with high localdensities could be explained if we admitted that the galaxies in denser regions are preferentially earlytype because of a morphologydensity relationeventually this excess in unbarred spirals would be cancelled by the fact thatinteracting earlytype sas have become barred at later times on this viewit is implicit that the morphologydensity relation is likely to be due to theinitial conditions for galaxy formation  see e g the biased schemeof galaxy formation blumenthal et al   or to global and localprocesses occurring at the beginning of galaxy life  see e g the densitydependent rate of conversion of gas into stars after galaxy collapse icke lacey and silk   rather than to late evolutionary processesthe two basic scenarios that we have outlined require dramatic possiblyunrealistic processes i e a radical change in morphology and a drastic dependence of bar stimulation on the morphology itself a scenario inwhich both processes occur simultaneously albeit in a weaker way seemsmore reasonable bar triggering easier for an earlytype spiral accompaniedby a slight change in morphology could lead to the almost discontinuousbehaviour observed in this case a primordial morphologydensity relationwould still be neededthe authors thank massimo

    "text": "introductionthis paper is concerned with the existence of maximal asymptotically п¬‚at initial data forthe einstein vacuum equations which contain trapped surfaces the signiп¬Ѓcance of this problemstems from the singularity theorems of general relativity  or rather the issues they raise takethe penrose theorem  for example this shows that a spacetime n with reasonable matterin particular a vacuum spacetime evolving from a noncompact in particular asymptoticallyп¬‚at cauchy surface fm  n cannot be nullgeodesically complete when fm contains a trappedsurface ts the theorem still holds when trapped surface is replaced by outer trappedsurface by a ts we shall always mean an outer trapped surface an obvious question to askis under what circumstances the tscondition is actually satisп¬Ѓed from the point of view ofthe initialvalue problem this question really consists of two partsts can one п¬Ѓnd conditions on fm  eg in terms of free data in order for fm to contain a what are conditions on fm so that there is a ts in a cauchy development of fm thirdly since the singular behaviour predicted by the singularity theorems is merely the existence of incomplete causal geodesics one would like to understand the local and global natureof these singularities in particular one would like to know does n satisfy some version of the cosmic censorship hypothesis cchclearly question  is the most interesting one since  and  are by their nature questions concerning the global cauchy problem see chrusciel  for a review of what is known inthis area they are also very diп¬ѓcult only in the case of gravity coupled to a massless scalarп¬Ѓeld and with spherical symmetry imposed on the geometry and the source has a full analysisof these issues been achieved in the work of christodoulou the present paper is devoted to the study for initial data corresponding to pure gravitationalradiation question  in the above list although this is a more modest task than attacking or  it is widely assumed that a full understanding of  should also shed light on the reason for this lies in the belief which is of course just one aspect of cch that themaximal cauchy development of an asymptotically п¬‚at slice fm with trapped surfaces is a blackhole spacetime in particular singularities should be inside the apparent horizon which inturn is surrounded by an event horizon no counterexamples are known to this event horizonconjecture see israel  for steps twards a resolution initial data like the ones constructed inthis paper are thus considered to be relatively safe from the viewpoint of cch at the otherextreme there have been studies of families of initial data the limiting members of which aresingular but without tss such families found numerically by nakamura et al  mimick theformation of naked singularities which shapiro and teukolsky  obtain in their simulations ofcollapsing localized dust since these solutions have only axial symmetry the singularities arethought to be a much more serious threat to cch than previously known counterexamples allof which are spherical sequences analogous to the ones in  but for the vacuum case whichare in a sense complementary to the vacuum sequences considered in our previous work have recently been found numerically by abrahams et al  see also omurchadha  thesemay be taken as possible evidence for the violation of cch even in the vacuum case but theissue is completely openthere has been considerable interest recently in conditions on cauchy data in order tohave trapped surfaces only the spherically symmetric case is fully understood so far  forgeneralizations of these results mostly motivated by thornes hoop conjecture see malec and flannagan  for a completely diп¬Ђerent approach based on a suggestion by penrose seetod  and barrabes et al  compare also the results of schoen and yau  togetherwith omurchadha in our work  we have shown the existence of time symmetric asymptotically п¬‚at vacuuminitial data with tss thus settling a question raised by bartnik  for earlier numericalevidence see eppley  and miyama  our construction is based in an essential manneron the conformal approach see choquetbruhat and york  to solving the constraints oftends to a п¬Ѓxed п¬‚at metric Оґ near inп¬Ѓnity and seeking as the physical metric a metric g inthere to be a solution of this problem this condition has the form of an inequality on a globalgeneral relativity in the timesymmetric case this consists of picking a metriceg on fm whichthe conformal class deп¬Ѓned by eg also tending to Оґ at inп¬Ѓnity this gives rise to an ellipticequation for the conformal factor eП† the lichnerowicz equation together with the boundarycondition that eП† tends to  at inп¬Ѓnity some condition on eg has to be satisп¬Ѓed in order forconformal invariant associated with eg the yamabe number y lee and parker  see alsoomurchadha  namely y   we now choose a sequence of metrics egn called a criticalsequence cs for which y   but tending as n   to a metric for which y   itfollows that the adm masses mn increase without bound as n   it furthermore can beshown that higherorder multipoles diverge no more rapidly than the mass for large n fromthis in turn one can infer that tss form the present work extends the above constructionto the maximal nontime symmetric case provided the suitably rescaled extrinsic curvaturestays bounded as n increases then the adm mass is dominated by its time symmetric partso that essentially the same conclusion obtains as before in the context of the discussion at thebeginning of this section some features of the above scenario are worth pointing out firstlyfor large n css can not result from time evolution via the einstein equations to see thisrecall that maximal asymptotically п¬‚at slices in a single spacetime asymptotically have to beboosts or translations of each other see bartnik et al  we now invoke the fact that thespatial metrics eg in our construction are in addition to being asymptotically п¬‚at at inп¬Ѓnity toleading order asymptotically spherical schwarzschildian to the next order this implies thatasymptotic boosts are no longer allowed and we are left with the possibility of slices which aremapped into each other by asymptotic translations but then the mass m has to be conservedwhich contradicts limn mn   this suggests that one way to improve our results wouldbe to try to establish a universal bound on y  below which g has tss so that it would nolonger be necessary to consider sequences with y   secondly it would be interesting to havea better understanding of y in terms of conformal geometry on the local or quasilocal level anduse this to study possible analogues of the hoop conjecture in the vacuum casethe critical sequences discussed in  are explicitly timesymmetric this means that thetss which form are both future and past trapped this in turn means that the spacetimesevolving from these data for large n are both future and pastincomplete thus if cosmiccensorship holds we should have a conп¬Ѓguration which starts out as a white hole in the distantpast expands to reach an instant of timesymmetry and then collapses to form a black hole inthe distant future in contrast in our current work we break the timesymmetry assumption onthe initial hypersurface by introducing some nonzero albeit relatively small extrinsic curvaturethus as we move along a critical sequence we do not expect future and past apparent horizonsto appear simultaneously of course if we move suп¬ѓciently far along any critical sequence theeп¬Ђects of the everincreasing adm mass will swamp the extrinsic curvature and we return tothe timesymmetric situation with past as well as future singularities still along any criticalsequence we should have a band of data solutions to the constraints with a future apparenthorizon but no past apparent horizon if they appear in the opposite order just multiply theextrinsic curvature by  these data now form possible candidates to generate spacetimeswhich represent the inп¬‚ow of gravitational radiation from past null inп¬Ѓnity of such an amountas to cause gravitational collapse and the formation of a black hole we realize that the absenceof a past horizon in an initial data set is no guarantee of regularity into the past see question of our п¬Ѓrst paragraph however it certainly is a necessary condition thus we can onlyclaim that it is plausible that at least some of these initial data sets that are singular to thefuture are regular to the

extended to a class of solvablebianchi models by a ashtekar r s tate and c uggla see grqcacknowledgement schapter introduction motivationfor many physically interesting systems not all points of the phase space are accessible the allowed classical states of the system are conп¬Ѓned to lie on a submanifoldof the phase space called the constraint surface now all empirical evidence supportsthe widely held view that the fundamental behaviour of all systems must be quantummechanical in nature and not classical as such we are concerned with the canonicalquantization of such constrained systemsa preeminent constrained system one that has withstood all assaults to quantizeit through at least  decades  is general relativity  of the diп¬ѓculties relatedto quantizing gravity a signiп¬Ѓcant part arises from the fact that in one way or theother current approaches to the quantization of constrained systems have not been quitegeneral enough to apply to general relativity almost all current approaches    relyon the presence of speciп¬Ѓc structures on either conп¬Ѓguration space or phase space anda generic constrained system may or may not possess these structures certainly it isnot known whether these approaches can be taken to quantize general relativitybefore i describe the features peculiar to general relativity let us brieп¬‚y recall gaugetheories to provide points of reference like general relativity gauge theories are п¬Ѓeldtheories with constraints on the phase space as fundamental theories of matter theyare of course important in their own rightgauge п¬Ѓeld theories are deп¬Ѓned on a background spacetime usually taken to beminkowski spacetime the elementary conп¬Ѓguration variable is a lie algebra valuedconnection on spatial slices of the spacetime cauchy surfaces and the canonical momentum is a triad which takes values in the dual to the lie algebra the constraintsurface can be speciп¬Ѓed by the vanishing of the gauss constraint functional dirac haspointed out  in the general context of constrained systems that due to the ambiguityin specifying the constraint function one is forced to consider that canonical transformations generated by the constraint connect physically equivalent classical states aswe know the gauss constraint generates gauge transformations ie rotations in theinternal symmetry group on the canonical variables dynamics is speciп¬Ѓed by a hamiltonian which is constructed however not just from the canonical variables but alsochapter from the nondynamical spatial metric all progress in the quantization of gauge theories has made essential use of this background spacetime metric the metric is usedeg to regularize operators via point splitting or other means to construct an innerproduct on physical quantum states and even to deп¬Ѓne perturbation theorygeneral relativity is markedly diп¬Ђerent from gauge theoriesit is a theory of thestructure of spacetime itself in the geometrodynamical formulation the canonical variables  are the dimensional spatial metric and its conjugate momentum the extrinsiccurvature of the spatial hypersurface there are four constraints on the geometrodynamical phase space the three independent vector constraints which generate spatialdiп¬Ђeomorphisms of the canonical п¬Ѓelds and the scalar constraint in the spacetime onecan construct from any solution the scalar constraint generates a timelike diп¬Ђeomorphism of the canonical variables hence in the spatially compact cases at least thescalar constraint is the generator of dynamical evolution this constraint is the primarysource of diп¬ѓculty in both classical and quantum theorythe most signiп¬Ѓcant diп¬Ђerence between general relativity and gauge theories is ofcourse the complete absence in general relativity of any background п¬Ѓelds be theymetrics or connections as one can imagine this absence of background structure hasprevented the construction of universally accepted and welldeп¬Ѓned regularizations ofthe constraints in quantum theory eventually the absence of background structure willalso make itself felt when one has quantum physical states and wishes to construct aninner product on them unless one has a prescription to п¬Ѓnd the physical inner productwhich does not depend on the presence of background п¬Ѓelds of course the lack of anondynamical background will also cause diп¬ѓculties in the construction of a physicalinterpretation of quantum gravityrecall that general relativity is the theory of spacetime itself and hence there cannot be an external time parameter in the hamiltonian formulation time is sometimesconsidered as hidden in the canonical variables themselves however there is no preferred internal time this diп¬ѓculty arises from the fact that up to the possible additionof a surface term the hamiltonian of general relativity is the scalar constraint thuson the one hand the scalar constraint generates time evolution where classically timecan be identiп¬Ѓed as an aп¬ѓne parameter along the orbits of the canonical transformationgenerated by the scalar constraint on the other hand since it is after all a constraintthe canonical transformations it generates must be viewed as gauge and since there isconsiderable ambiguity in deп¬Ѓning the constraint function there is at least that muchambiguity in identifying a timeone is not used to dealing with time as a dynamical entity in ordinary quantummechanics and in п¬Ѓeld theories the time parameter is available to us externally from thebackground spacetime furthermore time plays no role in constructing the kinematicalquantum theory ie in solving the constraints and п¬Ѓnding the inner product on the spaceof physical states from the point of view of canonical quantum gravity an importantissue then is whether or not time has п¬Ѓrst to be singled out from the other variablesbefore one can proceed with the construction of the kinematical theorythe diп¬ѓculties associated with the canonical quantization of general relativity whichi have discussed up to this point have been independent of any particular choice of canonical variables now i will concentrate on a particular formulation of general relativityintroductionwhich appears to be the most promising for quantum gravityin  ashtekar  introduced new variables for general relativity and formulatedit as a theory of the dynamics of a certain connection in terms of these variables afair amount of progress has been made towards a quantum theory of gravity fromthe point of view of canonical quantization there are some diп¬ѓculties endemic to thisconnection dynamical formulation of general relativity the new canonical variables are a complex su connection a and a real triade for connections which describe real general relativity the complex conjugateconnection is given by the reality condition a  Оіe  a where Оіe isthe spin connection of the triad immediately a seeming diп¬ѓculty presents itselfconsider eg the connection representation in which states are holomorphicfunctions of the connection Л†a the operator corresponding to the connection actsvia multiplication and the canonically conjugate momentum Л†e is represented bya holomorphic derivative operator symbolically a now the reality conditions on the classical variables imply hermiticity conditions on the correspondingquantum operators thus for real quantum gravity Л†e should be a hermitian operator how though can a holomorphic derivative operator be hermitian thusquite apart from the diп¬ѓculties associated with the constraints of general relativity within the contexts of the existing frameworks for quantization it is notimmediately clear that a description in terms of such hybrid variables will lead toany consistent quantum theory in the new variables much of the progress towards a quantum theory of gravityhas come about because the reformulation of general relativity as a connectiondynamical theory has allowed one to import and adapt techniques from yangmillstheory of particular interest for this discussion is the loop representation for atheory of a connection quantum states are functionals of loops in the spatialmanifold and the action of various operators is to break and join the loops inthe argument of the states in some ways the loop representation is like the fockrepresentation for maxwell theory states are not functions on some conп¬Ѓgurationspace neither are they functions on the phase space which satisfy some polarization condition of course operators on this space do correspond to functions onthe phase space however the most natural regularized operators on the loopstates are not the canonically conjugate pair of a e but certain loop variablessee eg    built out of the holonomies of the connection around loops inthe spatial manifold the wilson loops with triads inserted in appropriate waysthese loop variables are not canonical coordinates on the phase space though ina reasonably wellunderstood sense they do code the entire symplectic structureof the gravitational phase space to some extent one is familiar with dealing withnoncanonical coordinates in quantum theory however with the loop variablesthere is another diп¬ѓculty they are an overcomplete set of functions on the phasespace ie there are too many of them and they satisfy certain nontrivial algebraic identities how are these algebraic identities to be incorporated in quantumtheorychapter  the new variables approach is a connectiondynamical reformulation of generalrelativity there is the gauss constraint of yangmills theory which generatestransformations in the internal gauge group cintroductionof the background minkowski spacetime to construct an inner product on the solutionsto the linearized constraintsnone of the above techniques mostly п¬Ѓeld theoretic can be used to п¬Ѓnd an innerproduct for general relativity in all the above cases the availability of the backgroundspacetime metric and the simplicity of its structure п¬‚atness or stationarity is essentialto п¬Ѓnd the measure and has been explicitly used to do so in full general relativityof course one does not have this luxury the metric is now no longer a kinematicalbackground п¬Ѓeld but a dynamical entity except in reduced and simpliп¬Ѓed theories onehas to consider arbitrary positivedeп¬Ѓnite metricsconsider the usual metric representation in which quantum states are functions of metrics in this case for the inner product on quantum states one is concerned with themetric structure not of spacetime but of the superspace ie the space of all metricsnow the scalar constraint consists of two parts the kinetic part which is quadratic inmomenta and the potential term which depends only on the conп¬Ѓguration variablesin the connectiondynamical formulation there is no potential term the coeп¬ѓcient ofthe kinetic term in the scalar constraint deп¬Ѓnes a supermetric on the space of metricsone might be tempted to use the volume element of the supermetric to construct aninner product on quantum states integrating over the conп¬Ѓguration space as one doesin ordinary quantum mechanics the п¬Ѓrst diп¬ѓculty is п¬Ѓeld theoretic there are aninп¬Ѓnite number of degrees of freedom and such inп¬Ѓnite dimensional integrals are notin general welldeп¬Ѓned next consider spatially homogeneous cosmological models inwhich the components of the metric are constants on the spatial manifold and since theresulting conп¬Ѓguration space is п¬Ѓnitedimensional one does not have to worry about theп¬Ѓeld degrees of freedom even in these simpliп¬Ѓed models of general relativity since thesuperspace metric is of lorentzian signature its volume element cannot yield the correctinner product on physical states by analogy with the relativistic particle one mightthen consider the following alternative foliate superspace with submanifolds which arespacelike wrt the supermetric and use the volume element of the supermetric inducedon these spatial slices which is then positive deп¬Ѓnite to deп¬Ѓne an inner product forthe spatially homogeneous cases this might work though there is no guarantee thatit will however as a strategy for the full theory this will run into the п¬Ѓeld theoreticdiп¬ѓculties we discussed beforein the absence of a nondynamical background spacetime metric can one use thesymmetries of the supermetric instead to construct an inner product or select a uniqueground state the analog of poincare invariance in п¬Ѓeld theories is diп¬Ђeomorphisminvariance in general relativity hence one might imagine using the spatial diп¬Ђeomorphism group to select the inner product on physical states by requiring the uniquevacuum state to be spatially diп¬Ђeomorphism invariant however we cannot select thevacuum expectation value in this manner now the vector constraint requires that everyphysical state be spatially diп¬Ђeomorphism invariant are there other symmetries of thesupermetric that one could use in the geometrodynamical formulation the supermetric has no symmetries which also appropriately scale the potential  speciп¬Ѓcallythe supermetric admits no conformal killing vector п¬Ѓeld along the integral curves ofwhich the potential is rescaled by the same conformal factor while conformal rescalingis a symmetry of the supermetric it is not a physical operator and thus it has limitedchapter usefulness in singling out a ground stateapart from the lack of a general prescription for the inner product there is anotherreason that the procedure outlined by dirac is unsuitable for general relativity it implicitly relies on canonical coordinates and there is no discussion of the role in quantumtheory of algebraic identities between noncanonical coordinatesdue to the diп¬ѓculties which i have discussed associated with quantizing generalrelativity and the features peculiar to the new variables the dirac quantization programhas to be supplemented we need a general principle to select an inner product on acomplete set of physical states this principle should not rely on background kinematicalstructure as there is none in general relativity the new framework must be generalenough to include noncanonical choices of elementary variables and must establish therole of any algebraic identities that the classical variables may satisfyin additionthe framework should be able to deal with representation spaces which are not directlyconstructed on the phase spacein order to п¬Ѓnd or state such a principle we need to work with a speciп¬Ѓc techniqueto implement dirac quantization several quantization schemes exist like geometricquantization  group theoretic quantization  or feynmann path integrals  whichhave been successful in many cases path integrals for example have been tremendouslyuseful in perturbative approaches in п¬Ѓeld theory however as i mentioned earlier thesetechniques are too speciп¬Ѓc they rely on the presence of structure on the phase spacewhich may or may not be present in general relativity for example both geometricquantization and path integrals rely too heavily on conп¬Ѓguration space or at least apolarization on phase space to construct representations while these techniques haveworked very well for yangmills theory they are too restrictive for many constrainedsystems and in particular for general relativity our interest here is to construct ageneral framework applicable at least in principle to all or most constrained systemsand encompassing some of the above techniques the algebraic formulation of diracquantization  see appendix  provides a good starting framework which we canextend and completein this dissertation i will present the algebraic approach to the quantization of constrained systems which is broad enough to apply to general relativity chronologya general framework is now available which establishes criteria and provides guidelinesfor the canonical quantization of constrained systems at least as early as the osgoodhill conference boston university  ashtekar  pp  presented the essentialsteps based on an algebraic approach to dirac quantization a criterion for the choiceof the physical inner product was established which at the same time elucidated the rolein quantum theory of the reality conditions on the new canonical variables for generalrelativityintroductionthe general strategy outlined by ashtekar and the one i will present here is tochoose an inner product on the space of physical states such that with respect to itphysical operators corresponding to any two classical observables that are complex conjugates of each other become hermitian adjoint operators of one another in the chosenrepresentation though on the face of it this strategy appears obvious recall that thisis not one of the strategies commonly employed as the preceding discussion showstypically an inner product is found by other means and then one checks that variousoperators are hermitian with respect to it here one uses the reality conditions on thephysical operator algebra to п¬Ѓnd the inner productin addition based on ideas from the quantum mechanics of a particle on a manifoldsee eg  and  appendix  ashtekar realized that the classical algebraic identitiesbetween functions on phase space have to be satisп¬Ѓed by the corresponding operators inquantum theory in order to regain the correct physical sectorthe algebraic approach has now been adopted by leading researchers in the newvariables and the essential features have been discussed brieп¬‚y in recent reviews see  and in somewhat greater detail in various lecture notes  the criterion toselect the physical inner product has been applied successfully in the many п¬Ѓeld theorieseg maxwell theory + gravity and linearized gravity which have been quantizedusing the loop representation as well as the connection representation for full quantumgravity in the new variables the loop representation has led to a number of majoradvances of the various techniques for quantization which are currently in use thealgebraic approach is the only one which is complete and general enough to encompassthe loop representationi personally became involved with the algebraic approach when i tried quantizing acertain model the coupled oscillators model solved in chapter  since then i havestudied various other п¬Ѓnite dimensional test models based on the diп¬ѓculties and questions that arose in the quantization of these models ashtekar and i have completed theconstruction of a reasonably coherent algebraic framework for the canonical quantizationof constrained systems the focus of this framework is the construction of the kinematical quantum theoryie a unitary representation on physical states of a complete set of physical operatorswithin the quantization program itself there is no discussion of either dynamics or physical interpretation a further extension of the algebraic framework is required to extractdynamical information and physical interpretation from the quantum theory illuminating discussions п¬Ѓrst with rovelli  and soon after with ashtekar  clariп¬Ѓed manyof these issues for me some of the essential steps in a particular approach to physicalinterpretation are present in rovellis work  while my ideas on the dynamicaland physical interpretations of canonical quantum theories of constrained systems arepreliminary and possibly illformed i will discuss these issues too outlinein chapter  i will present the algebraic approach to quantum mechanics paying closeattention to the two new features namely the role of algebraic relations in quantumchapter theory and the criteria for selecting an inner product on a complete set of physicalstates initially the approach will be somewhat heuristic but in a later section i willalso discuss various technical detailsan alternative approach to the canonical quantization of constrained systems is the  in this approach the constraints are п¬Ѓrstreduced space approach see egsolved classically and then the reduced system is quantizedit is not always clearthat the resulting theory is equivalent to the dirac quantum theory in fact there areinteresting examples where they diп¬Ђerin order to compare the results of these twoapproaches i will reformulate the reduced space approach in the algebraic framework inchapter in chapters  i will construct the kinematical quantum theories for some п¬Ѓnitedimensional systems while many of the models share a number of features in common with general relativity some models are included speciп¬Ѓcally to illustrate the newfeatures of the quantization program in chapter  i will п¬Ѓrst consider the quantization of a free particle movingon a circle this is the simplest model in which nontrivial algebraic identitiesarise between the elementary operators and so provides a good illustration of theabsolute necessity of correctly taking these identities into account in the quantumtheory the next example in section  is that of the dimensional oscillatorin a hybrid set of variables one variable is real and the canonically conjugatevariable to this one is complex this model illustrates the use of the hermiticityconditions to п¬Ѓnd an inner product also the hybrid variables are the simplestanalogs of the new variables and this example indicates that it is consistent todo quantum theory with such hybrid variablesin section  i will quantizethe bianchi ii cosmology which is a spatially homogeneous reduction of generalrelativity we will see that even though the supermetric in the obvious polarizationdoes not possess enough symmetries of the required kind a complete set of physicaloperators exists and can be used to construct an explicit physical inner product the next model introduced by ashtekar and horowitz  is somewhat morecomplicated as one can see from some of the previous attempts to quantize itthe previous quantizations either displayed various unexpected features   orwere incomplete in some critical way  in other quantum theories the classicallyunexpected behaviour was ruled out by п¬Ѓat  as we will see in chapter algebraic quantization leads п¬Ѓnally to a quantum theory which is complete andconsistent in every way the п¬Ѓnal quantum theory displays no strange features in chapter  i will consider a model in which two oscillators are coupled to eachother via a п¬Ѓrst class constraint this is a model for a homogeneous isotropicrelativistic cosmology and in addition shares qualitative features with full generalrelativity from the point of view of the quantization program this model illustrates again the role of algebraic identities on physical operators the importance ofthe hermiticity conditions and the importance of discrete symmetries in pinningdown a unique inner product in the quantum theory of this model there is anunavoidable violation of classical intuitionintroductionthere are many classical systems in which the dynamics is generated by a hamiltonian which is constrained to vanish general relativity in the spatially compact case andin particular the homogeneous cosmologies are prime examples the nonrelativisticparametrized particle is another such model and in chapter  i will use it to illustratethe need for a framework to extract a physical interpretation from the quantum theory i will present two such frameworks one quantum mechanical following ashtekar kuchaЛ‡r  and rovelli   and another classical framework after rovelli i will then apply this framework to the issue of the initial singularity in quantumcosmologyin chapter  i will discuss in the form of a dialogue the lessons we have learnedabout the quantization program from the various models to which it has been appliedand some of the implications for quantum gravityin the main portion of the dissertation i deal only with п¬Ѓrst class constraints sinceas is widely known second class constraints have to be solved classically before thequantum theory is constructed in appendix a however i will present a way to quantize and solve second class constraints using a certain holomorphic Оґfunction theapplications of this are not immediately obvious but some possibilities do existi will assume that the reader is familiar with the following topicsi symplecticformulation of classical constrained systems    ii construction of the abstractpoisson algebra of functions on phase space and the algebraic approach to quantummechanics   see appendices  and iii elementary representation theory oflie algebras while some knowledge of these topics is helpful to understand details ofthe program i hope that the various models will enable even readers unfamiliar withthe above topics to grasp the ideas and concepts behind the approach sections andsubsections marked with a  may be skipped on a п¬Ѓrst reading without

algebraic quantizationof constrained systemsintroductionin this chapter i will present an algebraic approach to the quantization of constrainedsystems which is based on the representation of an algebra of functions on the phasespace in the section  i will present the details of the program following    seechapter  i will concentrate on the deп¬Ѓnitions that are used in the context of algebraicquantization   and heuristically establish the criteria to be satisп¬Ѓed by the choicesin section  i will summarize the quantizationone has to make at various stagesprogram condensing it into an itemized stepbystep outlinei will then make sometechnical remarks about various steps section  and postpone a general discussionabout the program until the concluding chapter after the illustrative examples andphysical models have been solvedprimarily the approach is an extension and generalization of the dirac quantizationprogram or the operator constraint method in the sense that the operator equationscorresponding to the constraints are solved in quantum theory  an alternate approachto the quantization of constrained systems is to п¬Ѓrst solve the constraints classically andthen quantize the resulting theory free of constraints in general the two approachesare inequivalent see eg    and then it is of interest to compare the resultingquantum theories hence in section  i will reformulate reduced space quantization  in the algebraic framework and discuss possible sources of diп¬Ђerence from the operatorconstraint approach algebraic quantizationconsider a classical system described by a phase space Оі a real п¬Ѓnitedimensionalsymplectic manifold in many physical systems not all points of Оі are accessible to thesystem only those points which lie on a constraint surface Оі described by the vanishingof some constraint functions on Оі are allowed classical states for the system recallthat in the terminology of dirac  see also  the set of constraints is п¬Ѓrst class ifchapter and only if their mutual poisson brackets vanish on the constraint surface classicallythis ensures that the gauge orbits of the canonical transformations generated by theconstraints lie in the constraint surface as dirac concluded after a careful analysis points on Оі that lie on the same gauge orbit describe equivalent physical conп¬Ѓgurationsof the classical system ie as gauge equivalent thus the true degrees of freedomof the classical system can be represented by the space of orbits of the canonical transformations generated by the constraints this space which has a natural symplecticstructure induced on it is the reduced phase space Л†Оіwe are interested in a general approach to the quantization of such п¬Ѓrst class constrained systems the steps in the canonical quantization of a п¬Ѓrstclass constrainedsystem are as follows set of elementary functions on phase spacein order to eventually construct the quantum theory we want to start with an optimumdescription of the classical system let us therefore consider the vector space s generatedby a suitable subset of the space of complex valued functions on the phase space Оіthis space has to satisfy three conditions in order to capture all the classical physics this set of elementary functions shouldbe large enough so that any suп¬ѓciently regular function on the phase space canbe obtained as possibly a suitable limit of a sum of products of elements f iin s this is ensured by requiring that at each point of the phase space Оі sshould contain a subset of functions which are coordinate functions in an openneighbourhood of the point technically s is locally complete if and only if thegradients of the functions f in s span the cotangent space of Оі at each point thatis we require thatrankciddВµf icid  nwhere dВµf i are the components in some chart of the elementary variables generating s and the phase space is n dimensional in order to construct the poisson bracket algebra of functions on phase spacewe require that s should be closed under poisson brackets iefor all functionsf g in s their poisson bracket f g should also be one of the functions in sfor all f in s the finally s should be closed under complex conjugation iecomplex conjugate f should be a function in seach function in s represents an elementary classical variable which is to have an unambiguous quantum analogin general s may be overcomplete ie the number of generators of s not including the constant function the gradient of which vanishes may be larger than n thealgebraic quantizationin this case the set of generators of s will satisfy somedimension of phase spacealgebraic identities are there any situations where one is forced to consider such genuinely overcomplete sets clearly if the phase space is irn then the global cartesiancoordinates and the constant function are a suitable choice for s however it is whenthe phase space is a nontrivial manifold that the point about overcompleteness becomesimportant there exist no global coordinates and unfortunately one does not knowhow to do quantum mechanics in coordinate patches one might attempt to construct a quantum theory on a speciп¬Ѓc coordinate patch however since for eg one maynot know the correct boundary conditions in general the quantum theory will not bewell deп¬Ѓned furthermore there is no way to patch together the quantum theorieson overlapping coordinate patches therefore an overcomplete set of globally deп¬Ѓnedfunctions becomes necessary one can then think of the identities as arising from theoverlap regions between two open neighbourhoods with diп¬Ђerent sets of coordinatesconsider for example the case when the phase space is the unit sphere in euclideanspace say centered at the origin this phase space arises in the classical description ofinternal spin   there are no global coordinates on s the pullbacks to s of thecartesian coordinates x y fail to be coordinates on s at the equator z   similarlythe pullbacks of Оё П† are bad coordinates at the poles however at each point of sone can п¬Ѓnd a subset of x y z which does coordinatize an open neighbourhood forexample as we just saw in the neighbourhood of the z   equator the set x y is abad set of coordinates however at all points of the z   equator except where y  x z is a good set of coordinates thus the set x y z is complete on s as we can alsoverify directly using  but now since Оі is a manifold the set of three functionsx y z is overcomplete we know that on s one cannot specify arbitrary values for thefunctions  x y z they have to satisfy the algebraic identity x + y + z     thevanishing of the function x + y + z   speciп¬Ѓes the embedding of s into irthus we see that in some cases at least the algebraic identities between elements ofs can be derived from the vanishing of the functions which specify the embedding of thephase space Оі into some irn in the general п¬Ѓnite dimensional case simple countingwill usually indicate the number of such algebraic relations that should be identiп¬Ѓed commutator algebra of functions on phase spacefrom the poisson bracket relations on s we want to construct the abstract commutatoralgebra of quantum operators following eg  appendices  and  associatewith each element f in s an abstract operator Л†f  construct the free associative algebragenerated by these elementary quantum operators impose on this algebra the canonicalcommutation relations ccrs for all f and g in the set s impose Л†f  Л†g  Л†f  Л†g  Л†g  Л†f  ih df gwhere df g denotes the operator corresponding to the function f g if s is overcomplete then as we just saw there are algebraic relations between its elements thusalso impose the anticommutation relations acrs which capture the algebraic identities between the elementary classical variables eg if all three functions f g andh  f  g belong to s then in the algebra impose the conditionЛ†f  Л†g + Л†g  Л†f   Л†hdenote the resulting algebra by achapter  relations on the algebraon a introduce an involution operation denoted by  by requiring that if two elementary classical variables f and g are related by f  g where f denotes the complexconjugate of f  then Л†f   Л†g in a the properties of the involution operation then deп¬Ѓne  on the rest of the algebra denote the resulting algebra by a the relationon a reп¬‚ects just the complex conjugation relations between the functions in s linear representation of aignore for now the  relation we just constructed on ain order to construct the quantum theory we want a representation of the abstractalgebra a via linear operators on some complex vector space v as in standard quantummechanics the canonical commutation relations  should be faithfully representedin addition the representation should be such that the anticommutation relations should also be satisп¬Ѓed note that for now the relations on a are to be ignored physical statesup to this point the constraints of the classical theory have been ignored we now wantto solve the constraints and isolate the physical states of the quantum theory thus wehave to obtain explicit operators Л†c on v representing the quantum constraints in thechosen representation if eg the constraints are quadratic or higher order in momentaone has to suitably factor order them while the functions in the set s have unambiguousquantum analogs operators corresponding to products of the elementary ones will ingeneral not have unambiguous quantum analogs the space of physical states vphy is thekernel of the constraint operators ie the set of states annihilated by the constraintsthus  П€ i is a physical state if and only ifЛ†c П€ i  this is the quantum constraint equation which has to be solved to yield the physicalstates physical operator algebrarecall that in classical theory the allowed physical states of the system solutions to theconstraint are points that lie in the constraint surface Оі as dirac noted physicallyalgebraic quantizationinteresting functions are ones which generate canonical transformations which leave invariant Оі the space of classical physical states these functions are the classical diracobservables similarly in the quantum theory we are interested only in those operatorswhich leave invariant vphy the space of quantum physical states not all operators in aare of this type an operator Л†a in a will leave vphy invariant if and only if Л†a commutesweakly with the constraints ie Л†a Л†ci xjЛ†f jiЛ†cj note that Л†f ij are operator valued structure functions ie they may not all be proportional to the identity operator furthermore it is important that various factororderingchoices be made such that on the rhs of the above equation the constraint operatorsalways stand to the right this guarantees that Л†ci Л†a П€ i   for all physical states П€ i ie that Л†a П€ i is a physical state if  П€ i is one the collection of all such operatorsforms a subalgebra of a the algebra of physical observables we denote it by aphyfrom the relation on a we induce an involution denoted again by  on thephysical algebra aphy see the п¬Ѓnal remark in section  denote the resulting algebraof physical operators by aphy physical inner productin order to answer or even pose physically relevant questions in the quantum theory sayabout various transition amplitudes expectation values or spectra of interesting physicalobservables we need an inner product on the space of physical states the general ideais to п¬Ѓx this inner product by requiring that various operators are hermitian with respectto it however since arbitrary operators in a are not operators on the space of physicalstates we cannot require that they satisfy hermiticity conditions with respect to aninner product on vphy on the other hand operators in aphy are operators on physicalstates hence we п¬Ѓx the physical inner product in the following mannerintroduce on vphy a hermitian inner product so that the abstract relationson aphy which have been ignored so far are represented as hermitian adjoint relations on the resulting hilbert spacein other words if Л†f   Л†g in the abstract algebra aphy then the inner product onphysical states should be chosen such that the corresponding explicit operators in therepresentation satisfy Л†f   Л†g where  is the hermitian adjoint with respect to thephysical inner product in the dirac braket notationh П€  Л†g П† i  h П€  Л†f  П† i chapter an inner product on physical states based on the algebra of physical observables andthus completes the dirac program note that unlike in group theoretic quantization no group theoretic or symmetry considerations are explicitly involved here neitherdo we invoke speciп¬Ѓc techniques to п¬Ѓnd the inner product such as kahler structures ingeometric quantization  summary of the programnow that we have considered the program in detail and have also provided the requireddeп¬Ѓnitions and established various criteria to guide our choices at the various stages iwill summarize the steps in the algebraic approach to the quantization of constrainedsystems this summary can serve as a ready reference for the reader through the following chapters choose a complete set of complex valued functions on Оі such that the vectorspace they generate is closed under both poisson brackets and complex conjugationidentify all algebraic relations that may exist between its elements construct the associative algebra a generated by the elementary variables in swith the canonical commutation relations and the anticommutation relations imposed on this algebra identify the involution corresponding to the classical complexconjugate relations on s find a linear representation of a on a vector space v ignore the relations inthis and the next step solve the constraint equations and obtain the space of physical states vphy construct the algebra a introduce on vphy a hermitian inner product so that the abstract relations onaphy are represented as hermitian adjoint relations on the resulting hilbert spacephy of physical observables remarksremark  inputs to the programat the outset i should point out that the above program is not a constructive techniqueto quantize constrained systems as a leading researcher in the п¬Ѓeld has so eloquentlystated  this program is not a meatgrinder into one end of which we can sticka classical system turn the crank and then expect to get a quantum sausage out theother end when following this program there are various stages at which choices haveto be made the п¬Ѓrst crucial choice is that of the set of elementary functions s a poorchoice of s may make it diп¬ѓcult to either represent the constraints or solve them oralgebraic quantizationп¬Ѓnd observables while there is no prescription to make a good choice which after alldepends largely on the intuition one has for the problem minimum requirements thats should satisfy have been established these requirements are essential in order thatthe quantum theory capture all the physicsthe second crucial choice is that of the representation of a on a complex vector spacev a poor choice of representation may again make it diп¬ѓcult to solve the constraintsif the representation is not general enough in some loose sense it may be impossible toп¬Ѓnd a physical inner product again there is no prescription to avoid such bad choiceshowever once a representation has been chosen and the constraints solved the programspeciп¬Ѓes the criteria that should be used to select a physical inner productremark  algebraic identities and quantum theorythere may exist algebraic identities between the elementary functions which are of amore general form than the simple quadratic case we considered in step  there is ageneralization of  consider the case when there are n sets of up to m elementaryfunctions the ith set denoted by f if im  which satisfy the identity pi f im   on the commutator algebra constructed from s one should impose   Л†f i  Л†f iЛ†f i      f im     f iЛ†f xiwhere as usual m denotes m times the sum of all the permutationsnote that even though we are imposing anticommutation relations there is nothingfermionic about the system further i should emphasize that the purpose of  is notto resolve any factor ordering ambiguity in the deп¬Ѓnition of the operator df g  Л†h sinceh  f g is by assumption an elementary variable Л†h is already an unambiguous andwelldeп¬Ѓned quantum operator rather the role of the acrs is to eliminate possiblespurious sectors in the п¬Ѓnal quantum description how do these spurious sectors arisein simple cases the left hand sides of the acrs eg the operator Л†f in  are superselected operators in the associative algebra ie they commute with all the elementaryoperators thus in these cases had we not imposed the acrs the representation of awould be reducible the irreducible representations would be carried by the eigenspacesof the operators Л†f  we would obtain the correct classical limit only in the sector onwhich Л†f takes the value zero by imposing  we ensure that the spurious sectorsare avoidedthe algebraic identities arise due to a failure of coordinatization of the phase spaceas we saw in the s example considered earlier we cannot classically solve the algebraicidentity for and eliminate one of the elementary functions globally on the phase spacethe identity then has to be appropriately incorporated in quantum theorygiven a classical identity f g  h is there any ambiguity in the quantum conditionthat we wish to impose as we will see rather than solving a factorordering problemchapter as one might have initially thought the algebraic identities create one a priori in thequantum theory one does not know what condition to impose suspend for a momentthe acr  and consider instead a nonsymmetric condition of the formО± Л†f  Л†g + ОІ Л†g  Л†f  О± + ОІ Л†hif we deп¬Ѓne Оґ  i О±ОІalgebraic quantizationhence for constrained systems it seems inappropriate to attempt to introduce apreferred inner product on all of v except perhaps as a technical device eg for regularization of the constraint operators in п¬Ѓeld theoriesremark  quantum observablesquantum mechanically the true degrees of freedom of the constrained system are codedin aphy the algebra of observables recall that in classical theory there is gauge freedomon the constraint surface not all points on Оі are physically distinguishable a somewhatsimilar situation occurs in the quantum theory too to see this let us explore thespace of physical operators an operator Л†a in a will leave vphy invariant if and onlyif it commutes with the constraints see  let Л†a and Л†b be physical operators Л†a Л†c  Л†f a Л†c and  Л†b Л†c  Л†f b Л†c then Л†a Л†b Л†c  Л†a Л†f b Л†c + Л†f a Л†c Л†b Л†a Л†f b Л†c + Л†f a Л†b Л†c  Л†f b Л†c  Л†a Л†f b + Л†f a Л†b  Л†f aЛ†f b Л†cthus Л†a Л†b also commutes weakly with the constraint the physical operators constitutean associative subalgebra of a with the induced commutator bracket denote thissubalgebra by aphysince the constraints are by assumption п¬Ѓrst class the constraint operators belongto aphy too this represents the gauge freedom quantum mechanically however sinceconstraints annihilate all physical states the algebra aphy of physical observables canbe obtained by setting the constraint operators to zero in aphy more precisely oneconstructs the ideal ic of aphy generated by the constraints one then takes thequotient of aphy by this ideal aphy  aphyic for physical operators quadratic orhigher order in momenta one п¬Ѓrst makes a factorordering choice and then quotients byicone may be tempted to shorten the procedure and quotient by the ideal generatedby the constraints in the large algebra a itself however it is easy to see that thisideal is too large in simple cases it is the whole algebra consider the constraint Л†p  since Л†q is in a and Л†q Л†p  Л† Л† must belong to the ideal ip but now since  Л†a Л†  Л†afor all Л†a  a ip  a thus the quotient is just the identity operator and all physicalinformation has been losthow do we know that the set of physical operators captures all the physical degreesof freedom to answer this question one has no recourse but to resort to the classicaltheory consider the classical functions classical dirac observables corresponding to thegenerators of aphy these are functions on the constraint surface Оі which are liederivedalong the orbits generated by the constraints and are thus isomorphic to functions onthe reduced phase space Л†Оі since Л†Оі represents the true classical degrees of freedom wecan require that the set of functions corresponding to aphy should be complete on Л†Оі aschapter in the deп¬Ѓnition of completeness of s see  this means that the gradients of thefunctions on Л†Оі corresponding to the generators of the physical operator algebra shouldspan the cotangent space of the reduced phase space at every point on Л†Оіhowever in the dirac theory one is not necessarily interested in constructing thereduced phase space indeed it may be quite diп¬ѓcult to do so in the absence of Л†Оі wewould like to formulate the condition for completeness on the constraint surface itselffirst consider the simplest case when the constraint surface is of codimension  iethere is only one п¬Ѓrst class constraint on Оі the gradients of the dirac observables areorthogonal to the hamiltonian vector п¬Ѓeld of the constraint function hence the pullbacks of the gradients of the observables to Оі span a n  dimensional subspace of thecotangent space to Оі in practice it may not be possible to coordinatize the constraintsurface and thus one may not be able to evaluate the pullbacks in a straightforwardfashion thus a more practical strategy is to explicitly include the constraint functionin the set thus the set corresponds to the set of generators of aphy as opposed toaphy and then require that at each point of Оі the gradients of this set span a n  dimensional space which is automatically orthogonal to the gauge vector п¬Ѓelds sincethe pullback of the gradient of the constraint which is normal to the constraint surfacevanishes this condition is clearly equivalent to the previous one in the general casewhen the constraint surface is of codimension m we require thatrankciddВµoicidcidcidcidОі n  mwhere Вµ  n dВµoi are the n components of the gradients of the functionscorresponding to the generators of aphy labelled by ithis condition is perhaps easier to visualize in terms of the hamiltonian vector п¬Ѓeldsof the observables we require them to span the tangent space to Оі however sincethere is no natural subspace of the tangent space orthogonal to the gauge vector п¬Ѓeldsone has to explicitly include the gauge vector п¬Ѓelds since the symplectic structure isnondegenerate it is easy to see that the condition  is equivalent tooicidcidcidcidОіrankcidx Вµ n  moiis the hamiltonian vector п¬Ѓeld of the function corresponding to the ithwhere x Вµgenerator of aphyas in the case of Оі itself if the generators of aphy are overcomplete or if one isunable to properly factor out the constraints classically then there are algebraic relationsbetween the physical observablesremark  physical statessince there is no inner product on the representation space v how does one know in step that one has a suп¬ѓciently large set of solutions to the constraints we now havethe machinery to formulate a criterion the space of physical states vphy should be largeenough to carry a faithful representation of aphy this is already an indication that theprogram cannot always be implemented as sequentially as it has been presented sincefor some systems one may have to п¬Ѓnd the full physical algebra and then go back andcheck that vphy is large enoughalgebraic quantizationremark  involution on aphyin step  we п¬Ѓnd the physical inner product using the relations on aphy and itis necessary and suп¬ѓcient to implement the hermiticity conditions on only a set ofgenerators of aphynow if Л†a in a belongs to aphy its adjoint in a Л†a may not belong to aphyhence in general the relation on a does not induce an involution on aphy in thiscase no prescription is available to select the physical inner product if on the otherhand Л†a  aphy  Л†a  aphy then we do obtain an involution on aphy denoted againby  and hence a physical algebra aphy which can now be used to select the innerproduct are there physical systems for which the above condition is guaranteed to besatisп¬Ѓed the answer is in the aп¬ѓrmative consider in particular the case when the  Л†ci i now if a physical operator Л†a commutesconstraint operators satisfy Л†ciif  Л†a Л†ci   then Л†a is also a physical operatorstrongly with the constraints iewe will see that this situation occurs in a number of model systemsin these casesthe quantization program can be completed successfully note however that it is notessential that the operators commute strongly with the constraints for the relations tobe welldeп¬Ѓned on the physical algebra for example if a set of generators of aphy areif they correspond to real functions on the phase space thetheir own adjoints ierelations on a induce an unambiguous relation on aphy reduced space quantizationas i mentioned in the introduction there is an alternative approach to the quantization of п¬Ѓrst class constrained systems in reduced space quantization one п¬Ѓrst solvesthe constraints classically and restricts attention to the allowed states which lie in theconstraint surface Оі recall that since the constraint surface is п¬Ѓrst class not all pointsin it are physically distinguishable points related to each other by a canonical transformation generated by the constraints are gauge equivalent thus one has to п¬Ѓnd theorbits of the canonical transformations by integrating the gauge п¬‚ats spanned by thehamiltonian vector п¬Ѓelds of the constraints the space of gauge orbits Л†Оі representsclassically the true degrees of freedom of the systemred of the space of complexvalued functions on Л†Оі anow one can construct a quantum theory on Л†Оі namely as in step  introduce asubspace ared is overcomplete onЛ†Оі and closed under poisson brackets and complex conjugation the variables in aredwill have unambiguous quantum analogs as in steps  and  above one now constructsthe abstract algebra ared since there are no longer any constraints to worry aboutthe п¬Ѓnal step here is to п¬Ѓnd a linear representation of the above algebra and to selectan inner product such that the relations on ared are represented by hermitian adjointrelations in the representationone is naturally led to ask for the relationship between the two quantum theories ingeneral this is a diп¬ѓcult problem complicated by the fact that the answer is not uniqueand depends on precisely how the question is framed however the algebraic approachto quantization is a natural arena in which to consider this issue and it does providechapter some answers since the generators of the physical operator algebra aphy correspondto a complete set of functions on Л†Оі eg the generators of ared one is naturally led toexpect that there is some correspondence between aphy and ared if there is a completecorrespondence between the generators of aphy and ared then one expects at least thelocal kinematical structure of the two quantum theories to be identicalthere are however a number of potential ambiguities first while there is a correspondence at the classical level there is no guarantee that such a correspondence existsat the level of the abstract operator algebras remember that the operators in aphyare obtained by п¬Ѓrst factorordering in aphy and then quotienting by the constraintsthus there is a factorordering ambiguity second while the overcompleteness of aphyis necessary it is not suп¬ѓcient to pick out a unique inner product in all cases preciselybecause it is a local condition on Оі and not sensitive to any large canonical transformations on the constraint surface for most simple systems the generators of aphy and aredmay still be in    correspondence with each other inspite of the above observationhowever there do exist counterexamples some of the systems we will examine admit discrete physical operators corresponding to large canonical transformations on Оіwhich have no action on Л†Оі whatsoever such superselected discrete operators belongto aphy and not to ared therefore even kinematically there is no guarantee that thetwo quantization procedures yield equivalent resultsare there any situations in which the two quantum theories are equivalent considerthe case when Оі has the structure of a cotangent bundle then if all the generators ofthe observable algebra are linear or independent of momenta there is no factor orderingambiguity and the theories are kinematically equivalent there is a unitary transformation between the two hilbert spaces which preserves the action of the generators ofthe two observable algebras ared and aphy however interesting dynamical variablessuch as the hamiltonian may be quadratic or higher order in momenta for these ingeneral there will be a factorordering ambiguity and depending on how it is resolvedthe two methods may lead to dynamically inequivalent theories in fact in a number ofexamples the prescriptions for factorordering which are natural to each approach

examplesintroductionthe algebraic approach to quantization that i presented in the previous chapter hasseveral new features in this chapter i will quantize some simple models each of whichallows us to focus on and understand one of these new features in a familiar settingin step  of the quantization program one has to select a complete set of functionson the phase space as i explained in the previous chapter one is forced to considerovercomplete sets ie sets in which there are more functions than the number ofdimensions of the phase space if the phase space is a nontrivial manifold which doesnot admit global coordinates this overcompleteness leads to certain algebraic identitiesbetween the elementary functions which cannot be solved globally on the phase spacethe algebraic relations are incorporated in quantum theory via  in section  i willconsider the simplest nontrivial manifold s as the conп¬Ѓguration space for a particleand explicitly п¬Ѓnd the algebraic relation we will see that the algebraic relation has tobe appropriately incorporated in the quantum theory in order to eliminate unphysicalsectorsanother new feature is the use of the hermiticity conditions on observables to selectan inner product on physical states as i discussed in chapter  this extension of diracquantization was motivated by the hybrid nature of the new variables for general relativity see eg  where one variable is real and the other is complex the canonicallyconjugate variables are a real triad e and a complex connection a which satisп¬Ѓes thereality conditiona  Оіe  atherefore an immediate question that had arisen was whether the connection representation is consistent can the momentum conjugate to a complex variable be itself hermitian the gravitational phase space is constrained and the new canonical variablesare not observables however the above question is about mathematical consistency andhence still important in section  we will consider the harmonic oscillator in hybridvariables analogous to the new variables for general relativity i will quantize the oscillator in these variables following  chapter  and we will п¬Ѓnd that implementingthe hermiticity conditions leads to a quantum theory unitarily equivalent to the usualchapter one thus there is no a priori obstruction to using hybrid variablesin section  i will apply the approach to a more physically motivated problemthe quantization of the bianchi type ii cosmology this is a constrained system and isexactly soluble in the usual metric variables a set of solutions to the quantum constrainthas long been available  see table iii pp  however to my knowledge there hasnot been a full discussion of the completeness of the set of solutions a physical innerproduct or the dirac observables i believe that at least in part this is due to a poorchoice of the elementary variables in terms of certain new geometrodynamical variablesintroduced by uggla   which are adapted to the symmetries of the problem andusing the quantization program one can п¬Ѓnd the physical inner product and the aboveissues can be understood this example illustrates the importance of a good choice ofelementary variables and subsequent representation since this is a constrained systemone can compare the dirac and reduced space quantum theories as it turns out in therepresentation we have chosen the dirac quantum theory is kinematically equivalent tothe reduced space theory particle on a circleconsider a particle whose conп¬Ѓguration space is the unit circle s in the euclidean planethe phase space is just the cotangent bundle over s and thus the symplectic structureis given by П‰  dp  dОё where p is the momentum variable note that even thoughОё is not a welldeп¬Ѓned function on s the form dОё is globally deп¬Ѓned and so is thesymplectic structuresince Оі  t s is a nontrivial manifold there is no global chart however one canchoose the following overcomplete set of elementary functions s   q  sin Оё q cos Оё p the commutation relations between the corresponding operators areЛ†q Л†p  iЛ†qЛ†q Л†p  iЛ†qand Л†q Л†q  note that these are the commutation relations of the dimensional euclidean groupclassically the functions q and q satisfy q   due to the nontriviality of themanifold this equation cannot be solved globally for one variable we impose the acr + qЛ†q + Л†q  Л†  on the quantum operators note that the operator on the lhs which we wish to set tozero commutes with all the generators of the algebra and hence with any hamiltonianthat one may construct Л†q + Л†q is the casimir invariant of the above algebra andthe acr requires that we restrict ourselves to the sector on which its value is let us choose as our representation space the space of smooth functions П€Оё on acircle of radius r a representation of the commutation relations  is given byЛ†q  П€Оё  r sinОёП€ОёЛ†q  П€Оё  r cosОёП€ОёЛ†p  П€Оё hsimple examplesnote again that while the coordinate Оё is bad the vector п¬Ѓeld Оё is welldeп¬Ѓnedhowever this representation is still manifestly wrong eg the spectrum of Л†q lies between r while classically q  in order to obtain a quantum theory with thecorrect classical limit we have to satisfy the algebraic relation and choose the r  representation only thus while the commutator algebra is correctly represented onfunctions on any s the correct quantum theory corresponds to a representation onlyon the functions on the unit s finally the inner product is simply h П€  П† i rs dОё П€П†one could have represented the commutator algebra on the space of functions on thetwo plane while this representation contains the physical one it also contains inп¬Ѓnitelymany spurious sectors unless the algebraic condition is also imposed the representationis reducible and since the lhs of the algebraic relation  is a superselected operatorits eigenspaces carry the irreducible representations note that this representation pointsout the importance of imposing the algebraic condition before selecting an inner productfor suppose that we assume an inner product of the form h П€  П† i rir Вµr Оё П€П† thenthe hermiticity conditions on Л†p imply that ВµОё   ie Вµ  Вµr now howeverto regain the physical sector the support of the wavefunctions has to be restricted tor   and the corresponding states are not normalizable unless we choose Вµ to be adistribution Вµ  Оґr    fractional statistics on sin group theoretic quantization  one constructs a unitary representation of a certaingroup with a global action on the phase space Оі the global

only the local symplectic geometry of Оі and a priori is not always sensitiveto the global properties of Оі thus even after imposing the correct acrs and thehermiticity conditions on an overcomplete

the kinematical quantization of this model we have found a complete setof dirac observables and an inner product on physical states such that the observablesare hermitian operatorsat this stage i would like to emphasize again the importance of the choice of elementary variables to п¬Ѓnd the dirac operators in the old variables  ОІa ПЂa one wouldhave to formally solve the heisenberg equations of motion with the constraint as thegenerator of evolution and п¬Ѓnd the constants of motion either classically or quantummechanically assuming this could have been done the formal operators would thenhave to be factorordered the enormity of this task can be seen by using the diracthe inverse  of the canonical transformationobservables cipcib  and expressing them in terms of  ОІ+ ПЂ+ by substituting  reduced space quantizationin chapter  i outlined an alternative approach to the quantization of constrainedsystems recall that to construct the reduced space quantum theory we have to п¬Ѓndthe space of the true degrees of freedom of the system and then quantizein thedirac quantum theory we constructed in the previous section we viewed the ПЂ as theconп¬Ѓguration variables thus the constraint was independent of momenta as waspointed out in section  for a constraint of this form the two quantum theories arekinematically equivalent in this section as an example i will explicitly construct thereduced space theory and demonstrate the unitary equivalence to the dirac theory ofthe previous sectionobviously it is most convenient to use the tilde variables introduced earlier toconstruct the reduced phase space we have to solve the constraint  and п¬Ѓnd theconstants of motion classically the constraint is most easily solved for ПЂПЂ  qsimple examplesЛ†bthe initial data is speciп¬Ѓed of all the constants of motion let us select ОІ as thegaugeп¬Ѓxing parameter since the constraint is solved for its conjugate momentumwithout any loss of generality i will set ОІ   now we can consider the п¬Ѓvefunctions p b П„  as coordinates on the constraint surface four of them p b arecoordinates on the reduced phase space which label the orbits and П„ is by deп¬Ѓnitionthe aп¬ѓne parameter along the orbits we can invert  and explicitly obtain theseп¬Ѓve functions on Оі substituting  into the canonical symplectic structure one seesthat the p are canonically conjugate to the bb Л†a p Л†b  Оґ Л†awhere Л†a Л†b  + are indices on Л†Оі the nonholonomic constraint  implies thatp+  now we want to quantize the system whose phase space is Л†Оі with the poissonbrackets  note that due to the presence of the nonholonomic constraint on p+ itis convenient to choose p+ and p as the conп¬Ѓguration observables the reduced phasespace Л†Оі is then a cotangent bundle over the haf plane Пѓr  p+   p with the bas the new momenta note that an upper lower index position is used for conп¬Ѓgurationmomentum observables momentum observables bv  v Л†ab Л†a correspond to vectorп¬Ѓelds v Л†ap on the

essentialaspect of algebraic quantization in this section i will summarize the lessons one haslearnt from these examplesremark the quantization of the particle on s illustrates the importance of the acrs beforewe imposed the acr  there were ambiguities in the theory which corresponded toa large number of spurious sectors in this example since the single acr is a casimirinvariant of the algebra a each eigenspace carries an irreducible representation of aonly one of these spaces in which the casimir invariant has value  corresponds tothe correct physical quantum theory the acr identiп¬Ѓes the ambiguities and imposing on the quantum theory got rid of the spurious sectors of course in this model itis trivial to see the ambiguities and resolve them the point however was not just tosolve the quantum theory of the particle on s but rather to understand the role of theacrs in a more general contextfurther as i already mentioned at the end of section  in order to be able to п¬Ѓnda good inner product it is important to impose the acrs and eliminate the spurioussectors before the relations are imposeda key feature of algebraic quantization is the fact that it frees up the choice ofrepresentation from ties to the phase space as we saw in subsection  this allowsus to consider representations which are unusual but physically signiп¬Ѓcant and whichcould not have been obtained in other quantization schemes where the representation ofa is constructed on functions on the phase spaceremark from the construction of the quantum theory for the harmonic oscillator in the q zvariables we see that it is consistent to use a hybrid set of functions one real onecomplex on a real phase space as the elementary variables for quantization on the faceof it it appears counterintuitive that a real momentum represented by a holomorphicderivative operator ddz can be canonically conjugate to a complex variable howeverthere is an inner product selected uniquely by implementing the relations on thesevariables with respect to which ddz is in fact hermitian this indicates that the hybridconnectiondynamical variables are a consistent choice for quantum gravityremark the homogeneous cosmological model bianchi type ii is the only constrained systemquantized in this chapter in the algebraic approach real physical observables should berepresented by operators which are hermitian with respect to the physical inner productthis model demonstrates that the above criterion can be used to explicitly construct aninner product on physical stateschapter in the ОІ variables the constraint  is separable the quantum constraint equationhas been previously solved the solutions are sinister looking bessel functions in ОІ table iii pp  and it is not at all obvious what if anything one can learn fromthem the set of solutions was in some ways considered complete however the hilbertspace structure necessary in quantum theory and a physical interpretation were absentuntil recently  there was no known inner product on these states the algebraicframework provides a powerful tool to п¬Ѓnd the physical inner product and it clariп¬Ѓesand emphasizes the role of physical operators since the problem is after all separableonce the importance of the observables was understood it was relatively straightforwardto construct them and then to use the hermiticity relations on them to п¬Ѓnd the physicalinner product as we will see in chapter  the existence of a kinematically completequantum theory does open up some possibilities to extract a physical interpretationthis model serves a few other purposes it illustrates the importance of making good choices for the algebra of elementaryvariables and its representation as i already mentioned the solutions in the ОІrepresentation are of a horrendous form more importantly it is diп¬ѓcult to seelet alone factor ordered and represented explicitlyhow the the physical operators ПЂ+  andcib+  could even have been found we began with a fairly general representation of the algebra a recall that in Оѕv  is an undetermined function in the representation of the momentumvariables it is necessary to include this term in order to satisfy some of the acrslater we make an ansatz for the physical inner product  and п¬Ѓnd that thephysical operators are hermitian if and only if Оѕv  is the divergence of the vectorп¬Ѓeld with respect to the measure Вµ however neither Оѕv  nor the measure isdetermined diп¬Ђerent choices of the measure Вµ change the explicit representationof the momentum observables but yield unitarily equivalent quantum theoriesthus the hermiticity conditions determine the relation between the representationand the inner product leaving us with the freedom to make unitarily equivalentchoices which can simplify the expressions of some of the interesting physicaloperators in this model dirac and reduced space quantization can be explicitly comparedi showed in this case that the two quantum theories are unitarily equivalent verifying the general claim made in section  that this would be so for constraintsindependent of momentabibliography ashtekar a  lectures on nonperturbative canonical gravity notes prepared

theory since this behaviour arose from precisely those features of this model that it possesses in common with general relativitythe authors speculated that similar surprises might occur in a quantum theory of gravityin this chapter i will reanalyse this problem in the context of the algebraic quantizationprogramlet us recall certain features of general relativity in the geometrodynamical variablesin the adm formulation the basic phase space variables are the metric qab and itscanonically conjugate momentum the constraint surface is speciп¬Ѓed by the vanishingof the scalar constraint

reduced space approach one п¬Ѓrst solves the constraint classically in the ah model clearly one can solve the constraint only in the region r   the resultingreduced phase space does not contain any classically forbidden sectors and the energyis positive everywhere on Л†Оі the analogs of the dirac states with negative energy areabsent from the quantum theory on Л†Оіin the quantum theory constructed previously the standard euclidean measure onir was assumed to deп¬Ѓne the inner product on physical states in terms of the presentalgebraic quantization program the steps missing from the construction of this quantumtheory are precisely the ones that require a physical inner product which realises the relations on the dirac observables as hermiticity conditions as we will see in detailthe hermiticity conditions are satisп¬Ѓed only if the measure has support only on theclassically allowed region c thus while it is true that physical states can have supportin the forbidden region since this region is a set of measure zero in the physical innerproduct they do not deп¬Ѓne unique states in the hilbert space states in the hilbertspace are speciп¬Ѓed completely by their support in the allowed region itselfthus at least for this model a complete and consistent quantum theory displaysno extreme quantum tunnelling a careful application of the relations eliminates thepathological negative energy states further as i will discuss in a later subsection thedirac and reduced quantum theories are almost equivalent dirac quantizationlet Л†r Л†Оё Л†П† denote the

representation of the elementary operators on somevector space of complex valued functions on the conп¬Ѓguration spacein this representation the constraint equation is a second order partial diп¬Ђerential equation whichwe solved explicitly this set of solutions is large in the sense that it includes thetunnelling solutions which penetrate the forbidden region next we constructed a setof generators of aphy the algebra of physical observables these operators act on thelarge space of solutions and leave it invariant then we attempted to induce the involution on aphy from a the s of most of the generators ofaphy were also in aphyhowever the  evaluated in a of one of the physical operators was no longer a physicaloperator itself thus we were unable to induce on aphy the structure of a algebrathis appeared to be an impasse in terms of constructing the physical inner product ala the prescription of the algebraic approachin desperation at this point we attempted to implement part of the relations ashermiticity conditions on some of the physical operators quite unexpectedly theseconditions forced us to rule out the tunnelling solutions the hermiticity conditionon one of the observables leads to the conclusion that all solutions to the constraintequation cannot be considered as physical states finally the algebra of operators onthe smaller space of physical states which does not include the tunnelling solutionsdoes admit a involution hence we were able to complete the quantization programnow let us consider the hamiltonian  in quantum theoryit is manifestlypositive on physical states the hamiltonian operator is ch  П€  eП†  П€ since thestates have measurable support only in c where eП†   hchi   for all physicalstates as promised a careful reanalysis of the problem has removed the peculiaritiesthat were present in the previous quantization while the п¬Ѓnal result seems somewhatdisappointing there are no extreme tunnelling states in the classically forbidden regionand the positivity theorem is not violated in quantum theory this problem clearlydemonstrates the power of the quantization program of chapter  while in retrospectour п¬Ѓnal result could have been obtained by a number of other quantization proceduresin other schemes the elimination of the spurious tunnelling states would almost certainlybe an ad hoc stepin fact based on an analysis of a similar model which is perhaps even more peculiarthan the ah model gotay  proposes exactly such a requirement for quantum theoryby п¬Ѓat the measure is restricted to the classically allowed region on the other hand inthe algebraic approach to quantization this result is derived from a much more generalhypothesis namely that real physical operators should be hermitian in the physicalinner productin another reanalysis of this model boulware  assumes the usual euclidean innerproduct on the representation space and requires that pОё be a hermitian operator onthe space of all ls states before solving the constraint equation and isolating thephysical states then physical states have support only on the classically allowed regionchapter and there is no tunnelling in this theory as in the case of gotays analysis the absenceof tunnelling is simply an input furthermore now a new problem arises a symmetricextension of Л†pОё was chosen by deп¬Ѓning its domain to consist of states which satisfy thefollowing conditionashtekarhorowitz modelare concerned since we are п¬Ѓnally interested only in their actions on physical states weneed not deп¬Ѓne them too precisely until after the constraint has been solvedthe quantization of a constrained system is inherently an ambiguous process onecan only require that the п¬Ѓnal quantum theory is complete and consistent in the sensethat one has a faithful representation of a suitably large algebra of observables andthat one recover the classical description in a suitable limit to achieve this end one isjustiп¬Ѓed in riding roughshod over the initial stages of the road to quantizationthus one can view the quantization of the ah model in the following way inthe early part of section  i exploited the freedom to deп¬Ѓne the representation spaceand the operators and was intentionally obscure about the speciп¬Ѓcation of v wethen made some choice of factorordering for the constraint and solved it on this spaceon physical states we deп¬Ѓned the actions of operators which formally had vanishingcommutators with the constraint then we imposed hermiticity conditions on theseand found appropriate selfadjoint extensions of the physical observablesthe only remaining thing is to check the subsidiary result whether dirac quantization and reduced space quantization indeed yield inequivalent answers reduced space quantizationrecall from section  that in reduced space quantization one solves the constraintclassically and п¬Ѓnds the reduced phase space Л†Оі and then quantizes the resulting systemfree of constraints there are two steps involved in constructing the reduced phase spacefirst one has to п¬Ѓnd ie construct an explicit parametrization of the constraint surfacechapter figure  ah model

considered so far the reduced phasespace for this model is not a cotangent bundle another novel feature is thatthe algebra of observables is overcomplete inspite of the trivial topology of thereduced phase space it is the requirement that the set of generators of aphy beclosed under the commutator lie bracket that forces one to include an extraelement in the set of generators of aphy thus there is an algebraic relation onthe physical observables in most of the models considered so far aphy has comprised of operators whichcorrespond to generators of continuous canonical transformations on the constraintsurface in this model as in the ah model there is in addition a discrete classicalsymmetry of the constraint call it parity which maps entire gauge orbits toentire gauge orbits a quantum operator corresponding to this symmetry must beincluded in the algebra of observables inspite of the fact that the set of continuous physical observables is locally complete the parity operator plays a role inobtaining an inner product on the physical states one can introduce a п¬Ѓrst class hamiltonian which satisп¬Ѓes a classical positive energy theorem in the canonical quantum theory section  there exist representations of the physical operator algebra in which the above hamiltonian acquiresnegative energy eigenvalues section  however going beyond the quantizationprogram and using

interpretationfor systems with aconstrained hamiltonianintroductionin classical mechanics interpretational issues are well understood the physical questionsone is interested in are mostly related to predictions about the values of various phasespace functions the issues of interest in a quantum theory however are generallyvery diп¬Ђerent from those in a classical theory in classical mechanics eg in the keplerproblem one is interested in questions about the orbits of the particle and in predictingfuture positions and momenta of the particle from initial data in the quantum theoryof the hydrogen atom on the other hand one is more interested in questions about thespectra of operators corresponding to various phase space functions eg the energy andangular momentum operators and the transition amplitudes between their eigenstatesto a certain extent we know that these are the right questions to ask because the fullquantum theory is available to usin general until one has at least the rudimentsof a quantum theory one cannot be certain that the questions one asks will remainmeaningful in the full quantum theoryin the quantum theory of constrained systems the interpretational problems arefurther complicated since not all operators can be considered physically interestingrecall that the allowed quantum states of the system are represented by the solutionsto the quantum constraint equations hence we are allowed to consider as physical onlythose operators which leave the space of physical states invariantnow given a vector space of physical states it is trivial to construct linear operatorson it say by selecting a basis and then writing down arbitrary matrices in this basis inthe loop representation for general relativity for example one can easily construct suchoperators on the known physical states they simply break and join loops in appropriateways however and i want to emphasize this point this construction is not suп¬ѓcientfor the purposes of quantum theory it is true that these are physical operators since byconstruction they leave the space of physical states invariant however unless one knowschapter which functions on phase space they correspond to one cannot relate mathematicalproperties of these operators to eg the results of measurements the main diп¬ѓculty isto obtain the correct hermiticity conditions on these operators and their interpretationthe above discussion shows that in contrast to ordinary quantum mechanics in thequantum theory of constrained systems one is interested in the explicit representationson physical states of operators corresponding to a restricted class of functions on phasespace namely the gauge invariant functions on the constraint surfaceamong constrained systems themselves there is a further distinction for ordinaryconstrained systems like gauge theories the hamiltonian which generates dynamicsis distinct from the constraint functions and does not vanish on the constraint surfaceon the other hand there are theories in which the vanishing of the hamiltonian is itselfa п¬Ѓrstclass constraint i will refer to such theories as dynamically constrained systemssince the dynamical trajectories are generated by a hamiltonian which is constrained tovanish general relativity in the spatially compact case is an important examplein order to understand some of the diп¬ѓculties endemic to dynamically constrainedsystems let us п¬Ѓrst recall some features of ordinary constrained systems in such systemssolving the constraints either classically by constructing the reduced phase space orequivalently a crosssection of the gauge orbits or in quantum theory by constructingthe physical states an operator algebra of observables and an inner product on thesestates is a purely kinematical procedure this construction is completely independentat least conceptually from the dynamical structure of the theory one does not need thehamiltonian to carry out the above construction after this kinematical constructionone can consider the issue of dynamics since the nonvanishing hamiltonian is п¬Ѓrstclass it projects unambiguously to the reduced phase space and all physically interestingdynamics can be considered to occur on the reduced phase space itselfin quantumtheory the corresponding hamiltonian operator generates unitary evolution on thehilbert space of physical statesin contrast for systems in which the hamiltonian is constrained to vanish kinematical considerations are intimately linked with the dynamical structure of the theory sincein such systems time is not an external parameter but one of the canonical variablesthe question of the identiп¬Ѓcation of the true degrees of freedom and the physical hilbertspace takes on dynamical overtones for example can one in fact complete the kinematical construction of the hilbert space of physical states without explicitly isolatinga time variable an equally important issue is that of observables the dynamicaltrajectories are gauge orbits hence a set of dirac observables or gauge invariantsis the set of initial data using these observables or even the constants of motion itis diп¬ѓcult to see the evolution explicitly how do we recover a dynamical picture forsuch theories where eg is a time variable hidden and how does one construct timephysical interpretationdependent states or operators or are constants of motion the only operators aboutwhich we can or would want to formulate welldeп¬Ѓned questions in quantum theoryclearly the dynamical treatment and physical interpretation of the two types ofconstrained systems distinguished recall by the vanishing or nonvanishing of thehamiltonian on the constraint surface will perforce be diп¬Ђerentin this chapter iwill concentrate on some interpretational issues in the quantum theory of dynamicallyconstrained systemsin order to focus on these issues consider as a speciп¬Ѓc example of a dynamicallyconstrained system the nonrelativistic parametrized particle as i will discuss in detailin section  the classical theory for the ordinary nonrelativistic particle can be written asa constrained system by including time and its conjugate momentum as extendedphase space variables and imposing as a п¬Ѓrst class constraint the condition that themomentum conjugate to time equal the true hamiltonian see adm  kuchaЛ‡r and references therein now in the usual unparametrized version of the theory timeis an external parameter evolution along which is determined by the hamiltonian inthe process of constructing a hilbert space of states one need not make any referenceto the hamiltonian or the time in subsection  we will see that for the parametrizedtheory too the construction of the kinematical quantum theory ie a hilbert space ofphysical states can be accomplished without isolating a time variable as far as thesecond issue that of the observables is concerned recall п¬Ѓrst that in the unparametrizedtheory one has no trouble posing questions about the action of instantaneous position andmomentum operators on the quantum states hence one expects that in the parametrizedtheory too one should be able to pose such questions now in the parametrized theoryit turns out that the algebra of physical observables is generated by the constants ofmotion eg the initial positions and momenta however in the quantum theory one isnot interested in questions only about the constants of motion as an example considerthe quantum theory of the hydrogen atom one is interested in the expectation valuesof the instantaneous position operator Л†x say to calculate the eп¬Ђect of a uniform electricп¬Ѓeld as a perturbation as we will see in the parametrized theory since Л†x does notcommute with the constraint it is not a dirac observable and one cannot calculate itsexpectation value on physical states how can one resolve this conп¬‚ict in the ability topose certain questions between the parametrized and unparametrized theoriesto begin with let us consider a related question in the context of ordinary gaugetheories ones in which the constraints do not generate dynamics can one only formulatequestions about the gaugeinvariant observables in a certain sense the answer is yeshowever since a gauge п¬Ѓxing or a crosssection of the gauge orbits is related to thespace of orbits the reduced phase space Л†Оі by a symplectic diп¬Ђeomorphism the pullback of an arbitrary function to this crosssection naturally deп¬Ѓnes a function on Л†Оі and isthus manifestly gaugeinvariant therefore corresponding to any function on the phasespace one can construct a gaugeinvariant observablethe details of the construction are useful to keep in mind during the rest of thischapter let О» be an aп¬ѓne parameter along the gauge orbits and п¬Ѓx a crosssectionО»  О» now consider an arbitrary function f onchapter gauge invariant observable corresponding to f in the following way first evaluate f onthe crosssection now construct a new function fО» by lie transporting this data onthe crosssection along the gauge orbits ie physical interpretationso far in the dirac quantum theory the above approach to physical and dynamicalinterpretation is even formally welldeп¬Ѓned only for systems which can be deparametrizedie where the constraint can be written as a schrodinger equation in a form linear in avariable which can be identiп¬Ѓed as the momentum conjugate to some time parametersuch systems are formally similar to the nonrelativistic parametrized particle which iwill discuss in section  on the other hand one can construct the reduced space quantum theory only for systems which have been completely solved classically but then forsuch systems the interpretational problem is well under control even if the constrainthas not been written explicitly in the schrodinger form in section  i will constructan interpretational framework for the reduced space quantum theory of dynamicallyconstrained systems along the lines of the approach discussed above for ordinary gaugetheories this closely follows the approach discussed by rovelli   in section  iwill apply this approach to the bianchi i cosmology and consider the issue of the initialsingularity in quantum theory in section  i will draw conclusions and outline someideas to extend the above interpretational framework to either dirac quantum theorieswhich are not in deparametrized form or reduced space quantum theories of classicalsystems which have not been exactly solved nonrelativistic parametrized particleconsider a nonrelativistic

physical interpretationfor all physical states П€q and П†q to determine the measure we impose the hermiticity requirements the condition that Л†qi be hermitian does not constrain the innerproduct in

cartesian the hermiticity conditions on Л†pidetermine the dependence of Вµ on qi the important point is that the dependence of Вµon q is left undetermined thus the innerproduct can now be calculatedh П€q П†qi  z dq Вµqchapter constraint generates dynamical evolution we know that the physical observables correspond to constants of motion which in turn can be identiп¬Ѓed with the position

operators on the initial state П€qi andthen evolving the resulting initial state forward to q using the constraint equationthis is exactly the procedure we have carried out as is obvious also from the secondequalities in  dynamics and interpretationare these the only operators or the only states that one can deп¬Ѓne recall fromthe introduction that in the classical picture on the constraint surface the space ofallowed classical states any crosssection of the gauge orbits say q   where forthe relativistic parametrized particle we have identiп¬Ѓed the gauge parameter О» withq is isomorphic to the reduced phase space there is a    correspondence betweenthe classical states points on this crosssection and the gauge orbits hence the pullback of a function to this crosssection naturally deп¬Ѓnes a

obvious disadvantages to the above frameworkin the п¬Ѓrst place it is absolutely essential thatthe constraint is deparametrized and expressed as a schrodinger equation secondlyeven when this can be done the solutions  one obtains are only formal expressionsand in general the observables  pose formidable factorordering problems in factas in ordinary schrodinger quantum mechanics the only known way to obtain explicitexpressions for  begins with diagonalizing the hamiltonian however there are many systems in which though a time variable can be identiп¬Ѓedthe constraint equation does not simplify to the schrodinger equation for exampleconsider the two coupled oscillator system quantized in chapter  for this model thenatural time variable is angular the momentum conjugate to the time

can be made choose П„ such that z i П„  is anew set of coordinates on the constraint surface note that nothing we have said so farprevents us from making this choice in fact this can always be done this choice п¬Ѓxesthe direction of the coordinate vector п¬Ѓeld of П„  it has to be parallel to the hamiltonianvector п¬Ѓeld of the constraint further since by deп¬Ѓnition П„ is an aп¬ѓne parameter alongthe gauge orbits we know in fact that  chapter structure on Л†Оі can be obtained from  now for each value of П„  one obtains a crosssection of the orbits evaluating  at a п¬Ѓxed value of П„  the rhs is a function on thereduced phase space and hence an observable thus  deп¬Ѓnes a parameter familyof observables corresponding to each zВµ these are the heisenberg observables notethat as heisenberg observables the poisson brackets between zВµ are to be evaluated onЛ†Оі and can be evaluated at diп¬Ђerent times П„ to construct the reduced space quantum theory one has to represent the

begin to quantize in the absence of the classicalsolution one can not even get oп¬Ђ the groundon another note an important conceptual diп¬Ђerence between this approach and thatof the previous section is that here the full constraint is thought of as the generator ofdynamical evolution whereas in the schrodinger approach a piece of the constraintis considered as the true hamiltonian correspondingly while the time variable oneobtains in the schrodinger approach is an internal time obtained explicitly right fromthe start as a speciп¬Ѓc function of the elementary operators the time variable in thereduced space approach is an external time only implicitly deп¬Ѓned by the solutions since the time is an external variable it belongs to a diп¬Ђerent set of coordinatesonphysical interpretationof

conversation mostly betweentwo characters achilles and the tortoise i have borrowed this format fromhofstadter  other characters put in cameo appearances the resemblanceof any of these characters to real persons is coincidentalachilles doubtless mr t this thesis has presented a reformulation in an algebraicframework of the dirac approach to the quantization of constrained systems somerather simple illustrative examples have also been worked out but what are reallythe new elements in algebraic quantization after all consider the issue of п¬Ѓndingthe inner product using the hermiticity conditions on certain operators isnt thisexactly what we do in ordinary quantum mechanicstortoise i would object that this not quite so in ordinary quantum mechanics achillesone has a metric on the conп¬Ѓguration space and its volume element deп¬Ѓnes an innerproduct on quantum states one then checks that various interesting operators areactually hermitian in this inner product if they are not one symmetrizes themthis leads eg to the addition of a chapter ОІrepresentation a large number of solutions to the scalar constraint were knownhowever it was not at all clear in what sense this set of solutions is complete orwhat inner product one could use on these statesthe algebraic framework provides criteria which resolve both these issues thespace of physical states should be large enough to carry a faithful representationof the physical operator algebra and the physical inner product on these statesshould be such that physical operators corresponding to real functions on phasespace are hermitian obviously in order to implement the criteria we need a complete set of physical operators however once these criteria were established wewere able to apply them eg to the bianchi ii model and construct the completekinematical quantum theory in this case a clever choice of elementary variablesgave us a complete set of physical observables and we then used the hermiticityrelations amongst these to construct an inner product on physical statesachilles consider that in bianchi models and indeed in full general relativity thescalar constraint contains a term quadratic in momenta whose coeп¬ѓcient deп¬Ѓnesa supermetric on the conп¬Ѓguration space couldnt we have used the volumeelement of this metric to introduce the inner producttortoise i dont think so this volume element does deп¬Ѓne an inner product on vthe vector space which carries a representation of the elementary operators themselves one can certainly use this inner product as a technical device for variousintermediate calculations however in general physical states are not normalizablewith respect to it as happens in bianchi ii models and a new inner product hasto be introduced there is another potential problem illustrated by the coupledoscillators and the ah model in these cases one can introduce an inner producton the representation space v make the constraint a hermitian operator on theresulting hilbert space and then solve the constraint equation there are normalizable solutions however if one does this the space of physical states may be justtoo small to capture all the physicsconsider also the quantum theory of chaotic systems perturbation calculationsfor some systems indicate that the spectrum of the hermitian hamiltonian becomes nondegenerate as one enters the chaotic regime now certain relativisticcosmologies may well be classically chaotic for these models the hamiltonianif one introduces an inner product on v itself and ifis constrained to vanishthe spectrum of the hamiltonian constraint is nondegenerate we would п¬Ѓnd atmost one physical state thus this quantum description would again be highlyincompleteachilles i see now that one should п¬Ѓrst solve the quantum constraints for the physicalstates п¬Ѓnd physical observables and only then construct an inner product on thespace of physical states that makes the observables hermitian but in previousversions of dirac quantization most of the emphasis was placed on the solutionsto the quantum constraint why do we need an inner product on these statesdont they already contain all physical informationdialoguetortoise to extract any physical interpretation one needs a hilbert space of physicalstates and a set of operators corresponding to п¬Ѓrst class functions on the phasespace one needs an inner product on physical states for the same reason as inordinary quantum mechanics one is not interested in just the wavefunctions andtheir support but in probability densities a particular physical state might befound to have large support in some interesting area of the conп¬Ѓguration space butif the measure itself is very small in that region then the state will not contributemuch in quantum theoryachilles aha the ah model of chapter  provides an extreme example of this therewe found solutions to the quantum constraint equations which actually had supportentirely in the classically forbidden negative energy regions since they werenormalizable in the п¬Ѓducial euclidean metric inner product one was tempted toconclude all sorts of interesting things in the quantum theory however since thephysical inner product vanishes in that region as elements of the hilbert spacethese solutions are identiп¬Ѓed with the zero statetortoise glory be achilles what a good example of the pitfalls associated with jumping to conclusions about the quantum solutions themselvesachilles another issue that has me confused is the following in the language of chapter general relativity is a dynamically constrained system in which the generatorof dynamics is constrained to vanish time is considered to reside in one of thecanonical variables for the sake of discussion choose a polarization in which thetime parameter is a conп¬Ѓguration variable in the dirac theory in the conп¬Ѓgurationrepresentation wavefunctions and in particular the physical states will dependon this time variable so any inner product would appear to necessarily involve anintegral over the time variable too now if one repeats this in schrodinger quantummechanics where too the states depend on time ie if one integrates the usualinner product over time to deп¬Ѓne a new inner product the states will not benormalizable in the new inner product doesnt this indicate that in dynamicallyconstrained systems too one should п¬Ѓrst isolate time from the true degrees offreedom and then look for an inner product involving say an integral over onlythe true degrees of freedom we did this eg in the reduced space quantizationof the bianchi type i and type ii modelstortoise true enough but one is not forced to take this approach let us consider whathappens in the nonrelativistic parametrized particle model which is a paradigmfor some dynamically constrained systems there as far as the inner product isconcerned we did not isolate a time variable in fact at the level of the kinematicalquantum theory we did not even explicitly identify a time variable now returningto the inner product this is a dimensional integral over all the conп¬Ѓgurationvariables q qi we followed the algebraic program blindly and imposed thehermiticity conditions on the observables lo and behold we did п¬Ѓnd the innerproduct on physical stateschapter similarly in the dirac quantum theory of the bianchi ii models we did not identifyany time variable yet there too the hermiticity conditions on observables yieldthe physical inner productin sum to п¬Ѓnd the physical inner product it is not necessary to isolate or evenidentify a time variableif we have a suп¬ѓcient number of observables we canfollow the prescription of the algebraic program and proceed to use the hermiticity conditions on observables to п¬Ѓnd an inner product time itself could be anapproximate or interpretational notion identiп¬Ѓed after the kinematical quantumtheory has been completedachilles i think i understand the separation of the interpretational or semiclassical roleof time from its role in п¬Ѓnding an inner product but if i recall correctly somethingunexpected happened in the nonrelativistic parametrized particle as we proceededto construct the inner product even after we imposed the hermiticity conditionson all the observables the dependence of the measure on one of the variables qwas left undetermined using the properties of physical states this allowed us tochoose the measure so that the integral over q was п¬Ѓnite and thus reduce theinner product to a dimensional integral over only the variables qitortoise if you think about it we do not encounter this unexpected behaviour only indynamically constrained systems a similar thing happened in the ah model butwe didnt pay much attention to it since it was so incidental at the time recallthat in the ah model the Оё dependence of the measure on physical states wasundetermined by the hermiticity conditions on observables although one couldhave done so we certainly did not consider Оё to be a timelike variablewhat is common to both models is the following recall that in each modelone of the momentum operators p and pОё respectively is represented by amultiplication operator on physical states thus we do not have to require thatiq or iОё is a hermitian operator and the corresponding derivative ofthe measure is left undeterminedso you see this unexpected behaviour is quite common and perfectly reasonableachilles if we do consider Оё to be a timelike variable in the ah model ie if weconsider the constraint itself as the generator of dynamics then it is a euclideantime in the sense that if the overall sign for the constraint is chosen so thatthe potential is negative and thus corresponds to bound states then the kineticenergy is positive in the bianchi models the natural time variable is lorentzianand in the nonrelativistic parametrized particle the time is newtonian yet in allof these models we were able to п¬Ѓnd an inner producttortoise hmm yes it certainly appears as if this issue whether in a particular modelthe time is euclidean newtonian or lorentzian does not play a terribly signiп¬Ѓcantrole as far as п¬Ѓnding the inner product is concerneddialogueachilles let me turn now to the second new feature the algebraic relations and theirrole in quantum theory why are these rarely encountered even in constrainedsystems like gauge theoriestortoise typically the conп¬Ѓguration spaces one deals with are linear spaces even forgauge п¬Ѓeld theories the conп¬Ѓguration space the space of connections is an aп¬ѓnespace hence one has the luxury of introducing cartesian coordinates and doingquantum theory or as in problems with spherical symmetry one is sloppy anduses spherical coordinates as elementary variables for the quantum theory suchcoordinates are complete but not overcomplete and there are no algebraic relationsbetween themin simple cases one can get by because one has experience inhandling pathologies that arise at points such as the poles on the sphere wherethe coordinate systems fail in general however one can simply get incorrectresultsbeaver but mr t why do you call this feature new i think one does encounteralgebraic relations in ordinary quantum mechanics consider something like cxp chapter there is another situation in which algebraic relations are unavoidable in spite ofthe trivial topology of the phase space this situation can arise because we areinterested in the manifold as a symplectic space not just as a topological or metricspace the cartesian coordinates on the phase space may not be canonical andin fact may not generate a vector space closed under poisson brackets then oneis forced to enlarge the set of operators even though it is complete and this leadsto algebraic relations for example when the energy diп¬Ђerence is imposed as aconstraint on a system of two oscillators chapter  the reduced phase space istopologically ir and cartesian coordinates are j however j+ j  j+j +Оґ as a symplectic manifold it is natural to consider the phase space to bethe future mass shell in dimensional minkowski space in order to do quantumtheory one has to introduce the additional function jz  j+j + Оґ and theappropriate algebraic relationso algebraic relations on s arise due to the twin requirements that s shouldbe overcomplete and closed under poisson brackets when there are algebraicrelations as we learned from the example of the particle on s the anticommutation relations have to imposed in quantum theory to ensure that one stays on thecorrect physical sector of the theoryachilles hmm long pause as he digests all this now i am confused about somethingelse general relativity in the new variables was mentioned as part of the motivation for formulating an approach which encompasses such algebraic relationsbut it is a theory of the dynamics of a connection and so the conп¬Ѓguration spaceis an aп¬ѓne space why are there algebraic relations in the connectiondynamicalformulationtortoise true the algebraic relations are neither unavoidable nor necessary in the classical theory however it currently appears that loops play a fundamental rolein quantum gravity for example the loop variables seem indispensable to express and regulate physically interesting operators without reference to backgroundп¬Ѓelds such as a metric or a connection it is in particular natural to consider theholonomies of the connection around loops as the elementary conп¬Ѓguration variables for quantum theory these holonomies are genuinely overcomplete andhence it is perhaps not surprising that there are algebraic identities between themhoweverachilles howevertortoise since the loop variables are nonlocal quantitiesachilles since general relativity is a п¬Ѓeld theorytortoise the counting of the number of algebraic identities is quite nontrivialachilles the counting of the number of algebraic identities is quite nontriviali see now that the algebraic approach provides a framework for canonical quantization which is general enough to apply to a large class of constrained systemsdialogueincluding general relativity also i think i understand the role of the two newingredients in this approach the use of the hermiticity conditions on observablesto п¬Ѓx the physical inner product and the presence and incorporation of algebraicrelations however i still have some questions about the general framework in theп¬Ѓrst place it is not really a constructive procedure for quantization for exampleone is instructed to п¬Ѓnd a representation of a but how one should do this is leftunspeciп¬Ѓed on the other hand in schrodinger mechanics one is explicitly given arepresentation even in path integral quantization fairly detailed instructions areissued it is another matter that there are immense technical diп¬ѓculties in carryingthem outgiselle in this sense perhaps geometric quantization is also not constructive one istold to п¬Ѓnd a polarization on phase space but one is not told how to explicitlyconstruct it however i get your general drift achillestortoise yes there is certainly much more freedom in the algebraic framework thereare speciп¬Ѓc steps at which crucial choices have to be made the п¬Ѓrst is in theselection of the set of elementary functions and a linear representation of theresulting operator algebra in general there will exist many overcomplete sets andrepresentations of the corresponding algebras may be equally easy or diп¬ѓcult toп¬Ѓnd however these choices will have ramiп¬Ѓcations later in terms of the abilityto complete the quantization a poor choice for s may make it diп¬ѓcult to solvethe constraints or п¬Ѓnd physical operatorsowl pardon me for interrupting but a dramatic example is provided by the bianchi iimodel in the ОІ variables even though the constraint had been solved explicitlyin terms of power series solutions a complete set of physical operators was notknown in retrospect we can see why in terms of the ОІ ПЂ variables the classicalexpressions for the physical observables are ridiculously complicated while apparently suitable in the sense that they satisfy the requirements of completeness andclosure the ОІ ПЂ variables are not adapted to the symmetries of the constraint andthe algebra of observables in contrast when we introduce the symmetry adaptedvariables  ОІ ПЂ the construction of the complete quantum theory is almost trivialtortoise as another example of a poor choice of s consider the coupled oscillators inreal cartesian coordinates and the schrodinger representation a few minutes oftoying around will convince anyone that this choice of variables and representationis obviously illsuited to construct solutions to the constraint equation particularly for the generic case when the energy diп¬Ђerence is noninteger solutions areproducts of generalized hermite polynomials with noninteger indices and thingsare a total messvan gogh right but considerable improvement is achieved by using a z z representation however a naive power series ansatz or the holomorphic representationdoes not yield all physical states since solutions to the constraint contain realrather than integral powers of z zin a more sophisticated representationchapter physical states are bessel functions and while it is quite unobvious and somewhattechnically diп¬ѓcult a physical inner product can be foundtortoise i have no objection in principle to technical diп¬ѓculties however in this caseit seems that the technical diп¬ѓculties may thwart one from considerable physicalinsight consider on the other hand the angular momentum like representationfor the coupled oscillators this is the ideal situation the representation is welladapted to the algebra of observables and chosen such that the constraint is actually diagonal solving it is then a piece of cakeachilles that brings up another question is there freedom in the choice of the physicalobservables tootortoise yes a trivial source of freedom is just the recoordinatization of the reducedphase space consider the coupled oscillators again since the reduced phase spaceis topologically ir one could introduce operators corresponding to radialangularcoordinatesachilles except that in quantum theory there are obvious diп¬ѓculties with this sincethe radius squared and the angle are then conjugate to each othertortoise i agree to continue my point a choice with nontrivial implications presentsitself in the quantization of the ah model there was an obvious choice of aset of physical operators which is locally overcomplete however as we saw thisset failed to capture some of the global structure of the reduced phase space andled to results that are qualitatively diп¬Ђerent from the correct ones in most otherexamples recall eg the bianchi i model the choices were rather obvious and soit is diп¬ѓcult to construct good examples of bad choicesachilles now in the next step we have to implement the relations on aphy to п¬Ѓndthe physical inner product if i recall correctly in both the bianchi ii model andthe coupled oscillator model even after all the hermiticity conditions are imposedthere is freedom to choose the inner product for as we have seen the relationsп¬Ѓx only the relation between the representation and the inner product we are freeto choose an inner product as long as the representation is п¬Ѓxed appropriately orvice versatortoise sure but in the examples you mention this freedom is rather trivial it iseasy to see that these choices yield the same ie unitarily equivalent quantumtheories it is still useful though since we can use this freedom to simplify therepresentations of interesting observablesachilles to summarize then the power of this approach arises from a tension betweentwo contrasting aspects the tight set of criteria that various choices should satisfyand the looseness in prescribing what those choices should betortoise exactly when taking the algebraic approach to the quantization of a problem one has to use ones physical intuition for the problem in making these choicesdialogueone has to anticipate the structures mainly aphy that arise in later steps anduse this knowledge to guide the decisionmaking in the earlier steps just as in aconversation one sometimes has to anticipate the other persons thoughts in order to decide what to say for example in many of the models we consideredwe used detailed insight into the algebra of observables before п¬Ѓnally selecting arepresentation of the elementary algebra a itselfachilles i was thinking  appears lost in thought  about the ah model againfirst it clearly indicates that one cannot always sequentially follow the steps outlined in section  in this model after step  we have a large set of solutionsto the quantum constraint equation however the operators that leave this spaceinvariant do not form a algebra and we seemed to be at an impasse inspite ofthis we tried to implement step  partially the relations on part of aphy thenforced us to go back to step  and discard many of the solutions from the space ofphysical states the operators that leave this newly deп¬Ѓned smaller vphy invariantdo form a algebra and we are п¬Ѓnally able to complete the quantization of thismodelsecond this model emphasizes the distinction between solutions to the constraintand physical states all physical states are solutions to the constraints but notvice versai am sorry i missed something you said a short while agotortoise not much i was just saying that in carrying out the quantization programone has to go back and forth correcting poor decisions taken in the early steps asones intuition for the problem develops as was emphasized in the discussion ofthe ah model we can insist only that the п¬Ѓnal quantum theory is consistent andcomplete we cannot quibble about the intermediate steps of course a completequantum theory is one in which we have obtained a faithful representation ofa complete algebra of physical observables the stepbystep approach and theconditions spelt out in chapter  are just guidelines to achieve this п¬Ѓnal resultachilles do we obtain an inner product or a quantum theory which is unique up tounitary equivalence if we satisfy all these conditionsst joseph oh no achilles even for quantum mechanics on a п¬Ѓnite dimensional manifold there are no such uniqueness theorems the only known statement thestonevon neumann theorem states only that there is a unique weakly continuous representation of the weyl operator algebra constructed on t irntortoise right in fact as you know there are inequivalent unitary representationsof the weyl algebra for the particle on the real line in which the spectrum ofthe momentum operator includes all real numbers but this spectrum is discretethe only problem is that these representations are not weakly continuous sincewe did not introduce topological considerations such discrete representations maywell arise in the algebraic approachchapter furthermore there are counterexamples in this thesis itself to a naive uniqueness conjecture recall the fractional spin representations for the particle on sand the intervals worth of ambiguity in the representation of the coupled oscillatormodel when the energy diп¬Ђerence is less than bibliography hofstadter dr  godel escher bach an eternal golden braid basic booksnew york division of harpercollinschapter appendix aquantization of secondclass constraintsin the main part of my thesis i have dealt only with п¬Ѓrst class constraints since as is wellknown second class constraints have to be solved classically if we were to represent theconstraint functions as operators then because they are second class ie because theydo not commute with each other weakly there is no common kernel  consider theaction of the commutator on states annihilated by both constraint operators clearly thisvanishes on the other hand the commutator is proportional to the identity operatorsince the constraints are second class and so we have an inconsistency more intuitivelyif there is a hermitian inner product on the representation space so we can calculateexpectation values then we see that a state annihilated by both second class constraintoperators violates the uncertainty principlein this appendix i will show that there is a mathematically welldeп¬Ѓned sense inwhich one can solve second class constraints in quantum theory of course sincethe argument in the preceding paragraph is a strict mathematical theorem one of itshypotheses must be violated by our solution we will construct quantum states whichare solutions to the pair of second class constraints these are not solutions in thestandard sense they are not annihilated by both constraint operators the idea is toп¬Ѓrst write the second class pair as complex conjugate functions of each other thensolve one of the constraints using a holomorphic Оґ function which i will describe insection a call these solutions the physical states now one can introduce an innerproduct such that the action of the second constraint on the above physical states resultsin states orthogonal to the space of physical states thus it sends physical states to thezero element of the physical hilbert space i will clarify this issue after i have presentedthe details of the solution in section athere are not yet any applications of this approach in which we quantize and thensolve second class constraints however there are situations in which this approach ispotentially useful and i will comment brieп¬‚y on these at the end of the appendixappendix aa holomorphic Оґ functionlet us deп¬Ѓne a

resonance data in order to estimate the continuum backgrounds listed in tables i and iithere is a small background of dв„“ candidates where the lepton is actually a hadron thathas been misidentiп¬Ѓed

estimated byperforming a similar analysis of the data where d candidates are paired with light hadroncandidates instead of leptons and scaling the result by the known electron and muon fakerates for this study a light hadron is deп¬Ѓned as any detected charged particle that fails veryloose electron and muon identiп¬Ѓcation cuts we use monte carlo simulation to determinethe eп¬ѓciency for

form factors aq aq and v q  these form factors characterize the transition between the two strongly bound states b and d and aretherefore not calculable in order to calculate the decay rate for b  d в„“ ОЅ and hence determine vcb from the measured rate it is necessary to know the normalization as well as theq dependence of these form factors several phenomenological models have been devised inorder to estimate the form factors but these typically assume some q dependence and usead hoc wave function representations for the b and d bound states hence it is diп¬ѓcult toestimate the accuracy of model predictions in order to compare diп¬Ђerent models we deп¬Ѓnethe form factor ratios aa and v a table vi lists the expressions for a aa andv a for the diп¬Ђerent models examinedrecent work on heavy quark eп¬Ђective theory and its application to the decay b d в„“ ОЅ has led to constraints on the form factors that permit a less model dependentdetermination of vcb in the limit of inп¬Ѓnite b and c quark masses the meson form factorsa a and v are well deп¬Ѓned functions of a single form factor Оѕy known as the isgurwisefunction  where y is the kinematic variable of hqet and is related to q by eq  theisgurwise function Оѕy contains the non perturbative qcd dynamics of the light degreesof freedom in the mesons and it is therefore not calculable however at y   point ofmaximum q it is normalized to unityfor п¬Ѓnite b and c quark masses the b  d в„“ ОЅ diп¬Ђerential decay rate can be expressedin terms of a single unknown form factor f y which incorporates the three form factors aa and v  the relationships between these and the isgurwise function are given by hqetonly to leading order and the corrections necessary to account for the deviation from theheavy quark symmetry limit are absorbed into f y following neubert  we writedОіand it is currently estimated that the second order deviations from the symmetry limit can becalculated with approximately  uncertainty  therefore a

theform factors describing the decay b  d в„“ ОЅ when extracting model dependent valuesfor vcb based on predictions of the form factors and their q dependence it is importantto determine the

    "text": "introductionsince the discovery of a considerable polarization of cidhyperons produced inclusively by high energyprotons  the phenomenon of hyperon polarization has been extensively

to be slightly larger at p  gevc than at p  gevc   measurablebeambeampolarization has been observed for some antihyperons such astaken into account both models provide a good agreement with polarization measurements inproton beamsthe dynamics of hyperon production in the forward direction by a hyperon beam are similarto those by proton beams however the strangeness does not necessarily emerge in the productionprocess but might originate from the strangeness already contained in the beam particle resultsfrom these measurements could give new insights into the systematics of polarization phenomenain this article we present measurements of the polarization of cid data analysisin accordance with parity conservation in strong production processes any nonvanishing polarization must be transverse to the production plane constructed from the beam and secondary particlemomenta thus the polarization axis is decidned as n kcid k where kand kprodbeampartbeampartare

does not cause such a distortion to correct for this distortion we usedcidan iterative procedure which started by ignoring a possible distortion using the bias cancellingtechnique a preliminary value

of the cidsample ciddecays were observedusing the electromagnetic calorimeter data by simulation of the cidproduction we determined that cid  of all selected cidcame from ciddecays thus the measured

be  cid  atcidcidp gevc therefore the cidcontribution to the overall cidsample attenuates the true cidtpolarization by a factor of about the discussionas discussed in the introduction the observed values of the hyperon polarization are strongly connected to the details of the production mainly the origin of the strange quark in our experimentthe strangeness of the secondary hyperons may originate from the cidbeam or be produced in thecidinteraction in the inclusive approach of this experiment there is no unambiguous way to distinguish between these processes especially at low x since the associated strange particles mayfremain undetected for the fragmentation region x  we expect a considerable contributionfof processes with at least one spectator quark transferred to the secondary hyperon which may bethe strange or a light quarkfor the cidproduction by cidonly the squark can be the spectator quark thus the cid+cid+polarization in a cidbeam should have features similar to the cidpolarization in a kbeam thecidcidcidcidpolarization has been measured in a  gevc kbeam at xcid  with the same inclusivefapproach  to be about + this polarization is attributed to the polarization of the spectatorsquark in the recombination process taking into account that the cidspin practically coincideswith the spin of the squark while the cidspin is opposite to it with a probability of  one may+expect a strong negative polarization of cidproduced in a cidbeam however diluted with respect+cidto the cidpolarization by a factor of  the argument for a dilution holds also for cidand cid+production in proton beams the measured dilution factor in this case is about  thus for ourcase an observable polarization of about cid may be expected such a value is also predictedby the recombination model  while the lund model  predicts a low polarization thelow polarization of cidobserved in our experiment does not show the strong polarization of the+spectator squark which appears to be seen in kbeam measurementscidfor cidthe recombination model predicts the polarization to be about half of that observedin proton beams which would be about cid the lund model predicts a low polarization weobtained a value signicidcantly lower than one half of the proton beam results if the full measuredprange is taken into accounttboth models considered predict the cidpolarization to be close to the polarization of cidprocidduced in proton beams in agreement with our resultsin summary we have measured of the polarization of cidreferences gbunce et al phys rev lett    ldeck et al phys

    "text": "introductionthe hadronic decays of particles involving heavy quarks are not yet well understood perhaps the best known example of an empirical law is the i  rule which states that in strange particle decays the i   amplitude dominates over the i   amplitude these are the only amplitudes available ink  ПЂ decays while transitions with i   and i   are possible ink  ПЂ decays they are not allowed in the conventional п¬Ѓrst order weak interaction the i state of pions is only accessible through additional mechanismslike the electromagnetic interaction that do not conserve isotopic spin the bestlimits for i   and i   transitions in k  ПЂ decays were obtainedfrom charged kaon decays a similar precision could not be reached in neutral kaondecays because of the diп¬ѓculty of measuring the kl  ПЂ decay only recently asmall but expected deviation from a pure phasespace density of п¬Ѓnal states in thisdecay was observed  additional information can be obtained from a comparisonof the branching ratios of kl  ПЂ and kl  ПЂ+ПЂПЂ decayskl  ПЂkl  ПЂ+ПЂПЂ and kl  ПЂkl  ПЂeОЅ as a byproduct the absolutebranching ratio of the kl  ПЂ decay is determined with better precision thisdecay is convenient for a determination of the kaon п¬‚ux in experiments on neutraldecays of the kl at high energies because it is essentially free of backgrounds fromother decays the branching ratio of kl  ПЂkl  all charged has beenmeasured once  with a relative uncertainty of  after a brief description of the apparatus in section  the event selection and theanalysis of these three decays are discussed in section  the results are presentedin section in this paper new measurements are presented of the branching ratios of apparatus and data takingthe detector used for this experiment was designed for a measurement of directcpviolation in a high energy neutral kaon beam experiment na at the cernsps it is described in detail in previous publications  for the beneп¬Ѓt of thereader a sketch of the experimental layout is shown in п¬Ѓg  it does not include thetransition radiation detector a special run with trigger conditions diп¬Ђerent fromthose in the na experiment was made for the purpose of the present experimentthe detector consists of two multiwire proportional chambers each with fourplanes of diп¬Ђerent wire orientation the chambers are separated by  m andare followed by a leadliquidargon electromagnetic calorimeter an ironscintillatorhadron calorimeter and a muon veto counter system a transition radiation detector located between the second chamber and the calorimeters is used for additionalelectron identiп¬Ѓcation the lateral division in  cm wide horizontal and verticalstrips in the electromagnetic calorimeter allows a measurement of shower positionand width due to the calorimeter length  radiation lengths electromagneticshowers rarely leak into the hadron calorimeter a scintillator hodoscope in front ofthe electromagnetic calorimeter provides trigger and timing information for chargedparticles a scintillator plane in the liquid argon serves the same purpose for neutraldecays the decay region is surrounded by four rings of veto counters which are usedin the trigger to suppress decays in which a photon or a charged particle escapes thedetector an evacuated beam pipe with an average radius of  cm traverses thewhole detector and allows particles in the primary beam primarily neutrons andphotons to pass directly to the beam dump and not produce backgrounds in thedetector the momentum range of kaons accepted in the analysis is from  gevto  gevthe trigger for neutral decays requires a coincidence of scintillators in oppositehalves of the electromagnetic calorimeter along with a total electromagnetic energyof more than  gev as well as less than  gev in the hadron calorimeter withthe pulse heights recorded in the horizontal and vertical strips of the electromagneticcalorimeter the number of peaks in each projection is determined online by fastanalog electronics at least п¬Ѓve peaks in one projection are required for ПЂ decaysthe distance between the decay point and the calorimeter calculated from the п¬Ѓrstand second moments of the photon distributions under the assumption that all thephotons come from the decay of a neutral kaon has to exceed  mcharged decays are selected by a coincidence of hodoscope counters in oppositequadrants for these events an energy deposition of more than  gev in thecalorimeters is required in the trigger further cuts then are imposed on the fractionof events for which online reconstruction is possible all events with a photonshower more than  cm from any charged particle in either the vertical or horizontalprojection are accepted in order to suppress ke decays charged events without aphoton candidate and with two space points in each wire chamber are downscaledand only one of п¬Ѓve of these events is recordeda total of    triggers were recorded during one day at the end of the lastrunningperiod of na the kl beam was run at half the normal intensity beforeand after the run the detector was calibrated in situ with ks  ПЂ decays from aks beam details of the data analysis that follows are given in ref data analysisthe data analysis closely follows the procedure established previously  forconvenience the same п¬Ѓducial volume for the decay points between  m and mfrom the end of the kl collimator was chosen as in the na experiment thischoice is originally motivated by the extent over which the ks target can be movedfor each of the decay modes the kaon п¬‚ux is determined  up to a constant factor as a function of the kaon energy from the observed data and the calculated acceptance the relative branching ratios are then measured in bins of kaon energythe п¬Ѓnal result is averaged over energy as a convenient way to describe the kaonenergy spectrum a function of the form f e  pe eО±  eОІe with a second orderpolynomial pe is used in the monte carlo programs with parameters adjusted todescribe the kl  ПЂ data see п¬Ѓg  this spectrum describes correctly all threedecay rates it is also consistent with the spectrum observed in the na experimentfrom kl  ПЂ decays in the same beam a precise description of the spectrumis not crucial what matters in this experiment is the ratio of acceptances thepertinent points of the analysis are given in the following sections kl  ПЂ decaysevents with at least  reconstructed photons whose energies are greater than gev and which are separated from each other by a minimum distance of  cm cm in both x and yprojections if they fall in the same quadrant are retained forfurther analysis each photon is required to be at least  cm from the center of thebeam line to avoid energy leakage into the beam pipe the longitudinal position ofthe decay point is reconstructed using the kaon invariant mass and is required to bebetween  m and  m downstream of the п¬Ѓnal kl collimator the best pairing ofthe photons to ПЂs is chosen to determine the vertex and momentum of the kaonbut no cuts on the photon invariant masses are made no cut is made on thecenter of gravity of the photon showers since only  of events have a centerof gravity in excess of  cm this is well outside the edge of the beam proп¬Ѓle at cm from the beam centerline the energy scale is calibrated with  relativeprecision in ks runs using the known position of an anticounter at the exit of theks collimator the systematic diп¬Ђerence between calibrations before and after thekl run is below  the energy scale is consistent within    with thescale deduced from kl  ПЂ+ПЂПЂ decays in which the calculated decay point ofthe ПЂ can be compared with the measured intersection of ПЂ+ and ПЂ tracks thetotal kaon energy is conп¬Ѓned to the interval from  gev to  gevthe acceptance is calculated for a uniform density in the dalitz plot thequadratic term does not contribute a statistically signiп¬Ѓcant eп¬Ђect to the acceptancethe simulations of the photon energy and impact point п¬‚uctuations are made withparameters determined in the na experiment  the measured distributions ofПЂ masses photon energies and impact points agree well with the simulation seeeg the photon energy distribution shown in п¬Ѓg  the acceptance depends onthe kaon energy п¬Ѓg  it is    on average for the decay kl  ПЂthe uncertainty reп¬‚ects the variation in the data with changing cuts most sensitive are the cuts in the minimum photon energy varied from  gev to  gev andthe projected distance between photons varied from  cm to  cm the relativechange of the acceptance is  and  respectively the spectrum obtainedfrom kl  ПЂ decays is compared in п¬Ѓg  with the monte carlo simulation theagreement is satisfactory this is not surprising since the parameters of the montecarlo are adjusted to describe this spectrum the position of the decay point alongthe the beam п¬Ѓg  has an almost uniform distribution well simulated by montecarlocorrections are necessary for photon conversion ПЂ dalitz decays for accidentals and for reconstruction losses they are summarized in table  events withspace points reconstructed in the п¬Ѓrst upstream wire chamber are not acceptedthe material in front of the п¬Ѓrst chamber is equivalent to  radiation lengthsessentially given by the thickness of the large vacuum window on the downstreamend of the evacuated decay region accidental tracks in the п¬Ѓrst wire chamber aredistinguished from conversions on the basis of their projected distance from showersin the calorimeter accidental photons are determined from the observed rate of Оіevents in  of Оі events an additional photon with more than  gev is foundin  of these cases the photon has an energy exceeding  gev from overlays ofobserved Оі events and Оі events with these accidental photons we estimate that of Оі events are lost and  are gained by accidental activity reconstruction losses are estimated from a sample of  monte carlo events which pass allcuts and in which full shower proп¬Ѓles as measured in the detector are simulated kl  ПЂeОЅ decaysevents with exactly two reconstructed space points in the п¬Ѓrst chamber and atleast two space points in the second chamber are candidates for ke decays cuts inthe distance of a track from the center of the beam pipe in the second chamber cm and in the position of the decay point m  z   m are imposed electronsare identiп¬Ѓed by their pulse height in the transition radiation detector trd andby the small amount of energy deposited in the hadron calorimeter the mean ofthe three lowest pulseheights from the four proportional chambers of the trd hasto exceed  counts for comparison the mean pulseheights are  counts forpions and  counts for electrons this limit is slightly energy dependent toassure a constant electron identiп¬Ѓcation   for all particle momenta inaddition the energy deposited in the hadron calorimeter has to be less than   ofthe total particle energy this cut is  eп¬ѓcient for electrons a combinedcut is therefore    eп¬ѓcient for electrons it reduces the chance for a pionto be accepted as an electron to about  since the branching ratios of decayswithout an electron are smaller than the ke branching ratio the contaminationfrom other decays in the ke sample is less than  the cuts do not make use ofthe normally narrow shower width of the electron radiative ke events are thereforeaccepted only events with more than one visible photon are rejected the lossesdue to accidental photons are negligibleevents are further restricted by kinematical cuts the measured energies of pionsand electrons have to exceed  gev the pion to electron energy ratio is requiredto be between  and  and their sum must exceed  gev the calibration ofpion energies followes the established na procedure which relies on calibrationswith pion beams and regular updates with muon data this calibration is furtherreп¬Ѓned in the present experiment with data from the ks runs by the requirementthat the invariant mass of the charged pions is centered on the k  mass thereconstruction of the kaon energy in ke decays is not possible event by eventbecause of the wellknown ambiguity in the longitudinal neutrino momentum thekaon spectrum is determined by an iterative procedure with appropriate weights forboth solutions the procedure was tested with simulated events it reproduces theknown kaon energy spectrum correctly over the kaon energy interval from  gevto  gev the algorithm is described in the appendix the agreement betweenthe kaon spectrum from ke decays with the monte carlo is reasonable see п¬Ѓg the direct comparison of the kl  ПЂeОЅ and kl  ПЂ spectra shows even betteragreement the ratio of the decay rates is consistent with being energy independentsee п¬Ѓg  the decay point distribution for data and monte carlo is shown inп¬Ѓg corrections are necessary for wire chamber ineп¬ѓciencies for accidental tracksand Оґrays in the п¬Ѓrst wire chamber for pion punchthrough and for trigger lossessee table  ineп¬ѓciencies in the wire chambers caused by missing signals or byfailure of the reconstruction program in case of additional activity are determinedfrom ke events deп¬Ѓned by the patterns of energy deposition in the calorimeters anda clean signature only  spacepoints in one of the drift chambers the event lossesare    in the п¬Ѓrst chamber and    in the second chamberyielding a combined chamber loss of    accidentals and Оґrays cangive rise to extra hits in the chambers in the п¬Ѓrst chamber however events withmore than two hits are rejected losses by Оґrays and accidentals are determinedfrom a sample of ke events which show two tracks with a common vertex in theп¬Ѓducial volume and in which no restriction on the number of space points in theп¬Ѓrst chamber is applied pion punchthrough that is muons originating from apion shower in the calorimeter and hitting the muon veto counter is determinedfrom events taken without a muon veto trigger losses essentially in the onlineprocessors are determined with a sample of events in which the online trigger isavoided but the trigger decision

opening angle less than degrees and carried out secondary vertex reconstructions threedimensionally finally wedemanded these pairs to be consistent with the assumption that they came from the eventvertices with a п¬‚ight length larger than  cm the invariantmass distributions of thesecandidate ПЂ+ПЂ pairs are plotted in figure  for the three tagging conditions respectivelythese invariantmass spectra were п¬Ѓtted with the sum of a secondorder polynomial anda gaussian distribution and the peak entries were obtained for no remnantjet andelectron tags to be       and    kss respectively the peakposition and the width were consistent with the detector simulation in order to derivethe diп¬Ђerential pt cross sections we divided pt into ten bins as shown in table  noticethat even the loweststatistics bin gave a Пѓ ks peak in the noelectron tag case background subtractionssinglephotonexchange process was a largest background especially for highpt ks thiscan be reduced when a cut was applied on the total visible energy we however did notcarry out this because we did not want to reduce the acceptance for highpt ks thecontamination from the singlephotonexchange process was estimated and subtractedusing the montecarlo simulation on a bin by bin basis the background fractions fornotag were          and  respectively for thept bins shown in table  being strongly pt dependent we estimated these fractions foranti and remnantjet tags they were consistent with the above values within statisticalerrors the background from beam gas interactions was estimated using the oп¬Ђvertexevents in the beam direction there was a vacuum leak in the beam pipe for some periodthe beam gas contribution for notag was  on the average and was subtracted fromthe data for anti and remnantjet tags the above value became slightly large ie electrontag sample was free from the beamgas background fcl noise hits werestudied by analysing random trigger and bhabha events the probability of noise hits withef cl  gev was estimated to be  while for hits with ef cl  eb it reduces to the fcl noise was also related to the vacuum leak in the montecarlo simulationswe added noise hits randomly in accordance with the observed noise hit probability inorder to reliably estimate the tagging eп¬ѓciencies using this the tagging eп¬ѓciencies ofthe remnantjet tag for the resolvedphoton and direct processes were estimated to be and  respectively systematic errorsthe systematic errors were estimated bin by bin as follows for the trigger we addedsome extra noise hits in the tracking chambers in the simulations for the event selectionand the ks reconstruction we changed the cut values and evaluated systematic errorsas the crosssection diп¬Ђerences we also changed the pulseheight threshold in the tpcsimulation to evaluate the eп¬Ђects on its tracking eп¬ѓciency we added the obtained systematic errors quadratically on a bin by bin basis the average over the pt bins of thesystematic errors was  of which the cut dependence in the event selection was thedominant source these systematic errors were quadratically added to statistical errorswe also checked the acceptance ambiguity due to the parametrization dependence ofthe resolvedphoton processes by comparing the lac  and dreesgrassie dg parametrizations the acceptance diп¬Ђerence was estimated to be  which is smallcompared to the systematic errors shown above resultsthe pt diп¬Ђerential cross sections were obtained from the number of reconstructed kssin each bin and its corresponding eп¬ѓciency estimated with the montecarlo simulationsdescribed previously they are listed in table  and plotted in figures  a  e for thethree tagging conditions and two subtraction schemes respectively figure  a is for antielectron tag events in the remnantjet tag events the montecarlo simulation predicted asigniп¬Ѓcant contamination from vdm events the tagging eп¬ѓciency for the vdm processwas estimated to be  slightly smaller than that of the resolvedphoton process inaddition there was a large ambiguity in the cross section of the vdm process thereforewe calculated the cross sections using two subtraction schemes figures  b and e wereobtained by subtracting the vdm contribution predicted by the montecarlo simulationvdm subtraction for remnantjet and antiremnantjet tags respectively here theantiremnantjet tag cross section was obtained by subtracting the remnantjet tag crosssection from that of the antielectron tag figures  c and d were obtained withoutthe vdm subtraction in figures  b and d the contribution of the direct process wassubtracted since the uncertainty in the prediction of this process was considered to besmall the histograms in figures  a  e are the montecarlo predictions the crosshatched singlyhatched and open areas are predictions for the direct resolvedphotonlac and vdm processes discussionsthe fraction of charm events was studied using the abovementioned montecarlo simulations we found  of these events with pt ks   gev were of charm origin onthe other hand only  of the events with charged tracks of pt   gev were fromcc pairs also the montecarlo simulations predicted that  of these highpt charmevents originated from the direct processin this study we derived six types of crosssections using diп¬Ђerent tagging conditions and subtraction schemes we can thereforeseparately compare each cross section with the theoretical prediction for each processfirstly about  of the highpt events can be explained as the electrontaggedevents see table  secondly for the antitag cross section figure  a the agreementespecially in the lowerpt region is reasonably good considering the ambiguities due tothe vdm process they are however higher than the theoretical predictions in thehighpt region pt   gev by Пѓthe cross section with the antiremnantjet tag is consistent with the predictions ofthe direct and vdm processes figures  c and e the hypothetical t pair productionwith mt and mОі gev   is expected to increase these cross sections by  and  pbgev in the highest three pt bins respectively which are smaller thanthe experimental errors therefore we could not discuss this hypothesis by this analysisresult note also that this hypothesis turned out to be inconsistent with the recent searchby the venus collaboration the dominant source of the discrepancy lies in figures  b and d ie in theremnantjet tag sample we considered that this sample was dominated by the resolvedphoton andor vdm processes the spectrum looks harder than the prediction of theresolved photon process the histograms in figures  b and d have already beencorrected by the nlo factor ptc+ ptc is a pt of a charm quark   this factor which is due to the presence of oп¬Ђshell gluon emissions from resolved quarksis large especially in the high pt region the measured spectrum is harder than thelo prediction and is close to the spectrum of the direct process our data suggest theimportance of the nlo correction the nlo correction to the light quark events whichis absent from our present montecarlo generator is also considered to be necessary inaddition the intrinsic parton pt we used  gev with a gaussian distribution isnecessary in summary the theoretical prediction agrees with our data to a reasonablygood accuracy justifying our parametrization of the montecarlo generationin order to check if the parton density functions have anything to do with the discrepancy we compared our remnantjettag data figure  d with the predictions from sixsets of parametrizations by hagiwara tanaka watanabe and izubuchi whit a systematic analysis on gluon distributions can be carried out using these parametrizations the results are shown in figures  a and b where the histograms are thepredictions by the whit  parametrizations with p mints of  and  gev noticethat the predictions are rather sensitive to the p mintcut and the vdm contribution especially in the lowpt region pt   gev there are some possible combinations whichreproduce the highpt cross sections well it is however necessary to improve the prediction of the vdm

    "text": "introductionrecently cdf presented evidence for top quark pair production both via the observationof events with two high pt leptons and via the observation of events with a w   or more jetsand a jet tagged as a b quark  in that analysis the distributions of speciп¬Ѓc kinematicparameters of the events such as jet energies and angles were not used to discriminatebetween signal and background it is of interest to search for evidence of top quark pairproduction based on this event structure and to determine whether one can select a topquark enriched sample of events with suitable cuts on kinematic variablesthe main background to tt production comes from higher order qcd productionof quarks and gluons in association with direct w production recent experiments haveindicated that the top quark mass is larger than of order  gevc    for such aheavy top quark it is diп¬ѓcult to distinguish the signal from the background based on theproperties of the w  however the jets in tt events have higher energies on average thanthose accompanying the w in direct w production and are expected to be produced atlarger angles relative to the beam direction in this paper we separate tt events where oneof the w s decays leptonically and the other hadronically tt  w +b + w b  lОЅb + q qbby exploiting these propertiesthe paper is organized as follows section  describes the analysis cuts used to deп¬Ѓnethe w + jet sample section  gives a brief comparison of the kinematics of directly producedw + jet events and of w + jet events from top quark decay and explains the analysisstrategy section  summarizes various comparisons of qcd monte carlo predictions whichsuccessfully п¬Ѓt experimental measurements in processes where a top quark contributioncan be neglected kinematic features of our w +   jet data sample are compared tobackground and to top quark prediction in section  this comparison shows evidence for atop quarklike component in the data section  combines this result with the independentinformation obtained from the algorithms which provide identiп¬Ѓcation of b quarks in theevents in section  as an additional test we look for an excess of w +  jet events in thetop quark candidate sample the conclusions are presented in section  data selectionthis analysis is based on  pb of data from  tev pin which both w s decay leptonically are removed by rejecting events with an additionalisolated track with pt   gevc in the central tracking system that is not associated withthe primary lepton tracks are deп¬Ѓned as isolated when the total transverse momentum ofthe charged tracks other than the track in question in a cone of radius r   centeredon the track is less than  times the pt of the track a study of a qcd multijet samplehas shown that fewer than  of jets with et jet   gev are rejected by this cut an additional z removal algorithm eliminates events with an oppositelycharged dileptonee or ВµВµ invariant mass in the range  to  gevca sample of w +   jets with the two leading jets having et jet   gev andО·jet   is selected where the tt contribution is expected to be relatively small thissample is studied in order to check whether the energy spectra of the leading jets agree withqcd prediction for direct w + jet production the search for a tt component is performedin the subsample with   such jetsthe primary diп¬Ђerences in event selection between this analysis and the analysis ofw +   jets performed in ref  are that  corrections to jet energy and et are madeprior to event selection  the jets are explicitly required to be separated by r   a cut is added on the transverse mass and  the rejection of events with an additionalisolated track is included these changes are made to simplify the comparison of observedjet energies with theoretical predictions for direct w + jet production and to reduce background from nonw sourcesthe fraction of all tt events that should fall into our w +   jet sample is determined from the herwig pp  tt monte carlo program and the cdf detector simulationcorrections to the acceptance for trigger ineп¬ѓciencies and diп¬Ђerences in lepton identiп¬Ѓcation between data and monte carlo simulation are identical to those described in ref for this analysis we п¬Ѓnd that the top quark acceptance ranges from  at mtopgevc to  at mtop gevc the number of tt events expected in the w +  jet sample using the standard model top quark production cross section from ref  isabout  for mtop   gevc using the cross section from ref  we expect +events we observe a total of  events  of them being in common with the  w +  jet event sample of ref  for top quark events the two sets of cuts make little diп¬Ђerenceabout  of all top quark events contained in the sample of  events will also show upin the sample of  qcd w + jet events often will be close to the jet et cuts thereforeonly approximately  of qcd events from the sample of  will also be found under thecuts of the sample of  if we assume that all  events are from qcd then we expect anoverlap of approximately  events to be compared to the observed overlap of  events w and tt kinematicsmonte carlo event samples are used to compare the distribution of several kinematicvariables for top quark and background events samples of top quark events of variousmasses were generated with both isajet  and herwig  and it was veriп¬Ѓed thatboth monte carlo generators give similar results w + jet events were generated accordingto the lowest order matrix elements for the production of a w with n п¬Ѓnal state partons thecomplete sets of matrix elements at tree level have been determined for n       andare implemented in the program vecbos  to avoid infrared divergences which wouldoccur at small angles and small pt

choiceyields the hardest jet energy spectrum of a number of q scales considered two diп¬Ђerenttechniques are used to transform the partons produced by vecbos into hadrons and jetswhich can then be processed through the cdf detector simulation one method employsa field and feynman fragmentation function  setprt tuned to reproduce thefeatures of observed inclusive qcd jets the other herprt  uses part of the qcdshower evolution monte carlo herwig in this case the events generated by vecbosare assigned an appropriate п¬‚avour and colour conп¬Ѓguration and are processed throughthe herprt initial and п¬Ѓnal state evolution program unless otherwise noted the resultspresented here will use the herwig approach the monte carlo events have then beenprocessed through a full simulation of the cdf detector and reconstructed in the samemanner as the datathe choice of suitable kinematic parameters to distinguish top quark events frombackground is presently the subject of considerable work the d collaboration has usedevent aplanarity and the scalar sum of the jet transverse energies  cdf has studied thesevariables as well as other parameters involving combinations of jet energies and angles work is presently in progress to identify which parameters provide optimal information inthis study we have focused the analysis on jet transverse energies and polar angles ourstudies have indicated that these variables are among the most powerful at separating topquark signal from direct w + jet backgroundjets are ordered in et with jet having the highest energy et  it was found thatthe et  or et  variables are better discriminant between qcd background and top quarkevents than et  a qualitative indication of the separation that can be obtained between ttand direct w + jet production on the

expected distribution of the jetsas a function of  cos Оёmax the maximum of cosОёjeti i is shown in figure athe inclusive jet distribution for direct w events is peaked in the forward direction whilethat for top quark events is more central as in ref  jet jet and jet are required tohave О·jet   the  cos Оё distribution after this cut is shown in figure b after theО·jet   cut our studies indicate that a  cos Оё cut still improves the signalbackgroundratio it also allows one to deп¬Ѓne a background depleted signal sample as those eventsin which each of the three leading jets satisп¬Ѓes  cos Оё   and a background enrichedcontrol sample which contains all events in which at least one of the jets has  cos Оё  the monte carlo predictions show that the cos Оё cut generates a harder jet et distributionfor top quark production while for direct w + jet production it leaves the et distributionsessentially unaп¬Ђected therefore an analysis which attempts to separate top quark frombackground based on the shape of the et distributions can be expected to become morediscriminating after applying the cos Оё cutusing the standard model tt cross section from ref  we expect approximately events in the signal sample and  in the control sample for a top quark mass of  gevcwhile for a top quark mass of  gevc we expect approximately two events each in thesignal and control

for the observed jet energy distributions for events that contain a w and   jets with the predictions of qcd directproduction of w and jets as implemented in the vecbos program it is therefore

for inclusivedistributions in  and  jet data samples  although the ua comparison and the cdfmultijet comparison involve a diп¬Ђerent set of matrix elements than for jets associated to wproduction they demonstrate that in terms of jet detection and reconstruction excellentagreement is obtained between observations and theory for events containing as many asfour jetsa good test is provided by the cdf

categorisedunder event selection track and vertex reconstruction track eп¬ѓciency and selection and datacorrection methodssystematic uncertainties arising from remaining photoproduction background were studied bytightening the ye cut from  to  and the Оґ cut from  gev to  gev the eп¬Ђects ofcalorimeter noise on the reconstruction of x were checked by tightening the yjb cut from  to the eп¬Ђect of a small mismatch in electron energy scale between the monte carlo and datawas checked by scaling the energy of the calorimeter cells associated with the electron in themonte carlo the overall systematic errors associated with the event selection were negligiblethe analysis was repeated using the second approach to pattern recognition track and vertexп¬Ѓtting see section  applied to both the monte carlo sample and the data this was foundto be a signiп¬Ѓcant source of systematic error the mean multiplicity results changed by  in general but the eп¬Ђect was up to  changes to lnxpmax

superlayer in the ctd this is aconservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty due to ineп¬ѓciencies within the detectorthe largest change to the mean multiplicity was   removing the pt and О· track selectioncuts produced changes in the results which were within the statistical errors the intervals inx q were chosen in order to maximise the acceptance in the current region and thereforereduce the sensitivity to these cuts the changes due to varying the parameters in the vertexп¬Ѓt were again within statistical errorsthe monte carlobased correction techniques described in section  are model dependent inorder to investigate the size of this eп¬Ђect the data were corrected with two independent montecarlo samples meps and herwig the diп¬Ђerences in the simulation of the hadronic п¬Ѓnalstate implicitly test the uncertainty due to the boost reconstruction which is derived fromthe da method the systematic uncertainties on lnxpmax and the mean multiplicity weretypically between   this is the largest single contribution to the overall systematic errorin the highest x q interval where the statistics from monte carlo and data are limited thelargest change to the mean multiplicity was inclusion of events with a large rapidity gap in the correction procedure was investigated bycorrecting the data with a sum of  ariadne and  pompyt events which reasonablydescribes the dis data  such events are a small contribution to the inclusive distributionand as a result the lnxpmax values are reduced by  whereas the mean multiplicities aremore sensitive and increase by    due to the eп¬Ђects discussed in section the systematic deviations from the above checks were combined in quadrature to yield thequoted systematic errors results multiplicitythe variables and distributions presented in the following sections have been corrected fordetector and acceptance eп¬Ђects the multiplicity distributions are binned in x and q asindicated in table  in the intervals    x    and   q   gev wherethe mean values of q range from   to  gev figure  shows the measured multiplicitydistributions in the current region of the breit frame with increasing q the mean of themultiplicity increases at low q there is a signiп¬Ѓcant probability for no tracks to be found inthe current region which we address later the multiplicity distributions are compared to theariadne monte carlo which reproduces the data in each x q intervalin order to compare the multiplicity distributions at various values of q the scaled multiplicitydistributions П€z  nch  p nch are plotted as a function of z  nchgenerators predict a higher multiplicity for the higher x range at п¬Ѓxed q values herwigwhich includes coherent parton showers but has no explicit matrix element also reproducesthe increase with q coherence suppresses the production of large multiplicity events whichbecomes a more noticeable eп¬Ђect with increasing qthe eп¬Ђects of coherence on the evolution of the parton shower have been tested by calculatingthe mean multiplicity with the meps model with default parameter settings as shown inп¬Ѓgure b the meps incoherent parton shower with independent fragmentation exhibits afaster growth of the multiplicity than seen in the data the discontinuities in the lines correspond to predictions for two diп¬Ђerent x values at п¬Ѓxed q the growth of the incoherent caseis damped when string fragmentation is used rather than independent fragmentation but notenough to agree with the data additional lowmomentum partons produced in the incoherentshower correspond to small kinks of the lund string these therefore lead to relatively smalldiп¬Ђerences between the incoherent and coherent case when string fragmentation is applied overall however the data are best described by monte carlo models that include coherencein their simulations whilst those with an incoherent shower are less successful in reproducingthe multiplicity distributions and the growth of  nch  with qthe deп¬Ѓnition used here for associating particles with the current fragmentation region namelypz   should be considered an operational deп¬Ѓnition which is unambiguous only when theproduced jet and the fragmentation products are massless if these are massive andor if qcdradiation is included the current and target fragmentation regions begin to merge considerfor example the case where the struck quark branches into a quark and a gluon producing a qgsystem with mass m being massive the zmomentum of the qg system becomes more positivea special case is m  q where the qg system is at rest in the breit frame if instead of thedeп¬Ѓnition used in this paper one would take the point of view that the current fragmentationshould include the particles emerging from the hadronisation of the outgoing quark and gluonthen the current region deп¬Ѓned by pz   would contain only part of the fragmentation productsthe bremsstrahlung nature of qcd radiation results in partons which are mostly soft andcollinear leading to small masses m clearly the eп¬Ђect should be small if q  m twoexercises were made in order to estimate the size of the eп¬Ђect keeping the deп¬Ѓnition of thecurrent region as before namely pz  in the п¬Ѓrst study the multiplicities in the current region predicted by the qpm and the memodel ie п¬Ѓrstorder qcd matrix elements without parton showers were compared thefragmentation was performed in both cases according to the lund scheme in the me calculation qcd branching is considered if yij  ycut where yij  mijw  here mij is themass of the parton system produced in the branching and w is the total centre of mass energyavailable for hadron production the calculation was performed choosing a standard value ofycut   note that this choice of ycut corresponds to a hard branching which is a relativelyrare process the average multiplicities predicted by me at q   gev were found to be lower than those of qpm the diп¬Ђerence becoming smaller as q increasedin the second study this eп¬Ђect was investigated with data by comparing events with andwithout a large rapidity gap for large rapidity gap lrg events qcd radiation is suppressedcompared to events without a large rapidity gap  therefore the depopulation of the currentregion due to qcd radiation should also be suppressed in lrg events indeed in the lowestq interval q   gev lrg events were observed to have an   higher multiplicitycompared with nonlrg for q   gev the excess was   and for q   gev thesame multiplicity was observed for both event classes within errorsthe preceding considerations suggest that for q   gev the diп¬Ђerent deп¬Ѓnitions of thecurrent region lead to approximately the same results for current fragmentation and that thedata obtained here from dis can be directly compared with those on quark fragmentationmeasured in e+e annihilationin п¬Ѓgure  twice the mean multiplicity is compared with inclusive mean multiplicity measurements from e+e experiments     for q  also shown is the statistical п¬Ѓt to the data when b   c     which wouldbe the case if the qcd cascade was of an incoherent nature dominated by cylindrical phasespace a discussion of phase space eп¬Ђects is given in  in such a case the logarithmicparticle momentum spectrum would be peaked at a constant value of momentum independentof q the observed gradient is clearly inconsistent with b   and therefore inconsistent withcylindrical phase spacein п¬Ѓgure a the measurements are compared with the results from the ariadne herwigand meps monte carlo simulations these models describe the lnxp distributions and theevolution of their maximum as well as the multiplicity distributions shown in section  as inthe case of  nch  the diп¬Ђerence between the coherent and incoherent growth of lnxpmax isfound to be reduced when string fragmentation is used rather than independent fragmentation п¬Ѓgure b again the lnxp distributions and the growth of lnxpmax with q arewelldescribed by monte carlo models that include coherence in their simulations whilst thosewith an incoherent shower are less successful in describing the datain contrast to the  nch  measurements the lnxpmax values change only slightly when onlythe rapidity gap events are used with a maximum negative shift of   in the lowest x qinterval eп¬Ђects due to primary heavyquark production were also found to be negligiblethe evolution of lnxpmax seen in dis agrees with the e+e data the growth is at a slowerrate than that expected from cylindrical phase space indicative of coherence monte carlomodels including coherence eп¬Ђects describe the lnxpmax values and the lnxp distributionsbetter than those with an incoherent behaviour the rate of growth with increasing q of  nch and lnxpmax in the current region of the breit frame agrees with e+e data in the regionof overlap ie above  gev indicating that the fragmentation of quarks in dis is similar tothat of quarks produced in e+e annihilation comparisons with

measured in the detector to hard partonic processes results on twojet production in dis have been published previously by the zeus collaboration based on a cone algorithm using a cone of radius r  qthe losses in the forward beam pipe of the zeus detector are taken into account by addinga п¬Ѓctitious cluster called pseudoparticle in the forward direction to which the missing longitudinal

two jets is shown the jets are ordered in О· thehigher О· jet is usually found very close to the forward beam pipe about half of the jet axesare reconstructed in cells within  cm of the fcal region near the beam pipe Оё  inthis forward region the results depend on the description of the initial state parton shower andof the target fragmentation in the monte carlo generator as well as on the

general a gooddescription of the data fig bthe distributions of the diп¬Ђerences in azimuthal angle П†jet fig a and pseudorapidityО·jet fig b between the two jets show that the jets found by the

scaling variablesstrongly depend on the choice of jet algorithm in comparison to the jade algorithm the kalgorithm  leads to a much less peaked z distribution the k algorithm was not used forthis analysis because the nlo calculations for dis are based only on the jade scheme jet ratesthe twojet rate r+ is deп¬Ѓned by the ratior+ n+and the transverse momentum of the two jets are large enough to allow a description in termsof perturbative qcd for the п¬Ѓrst time in dis the partonic scaling variables xp and z havebeen reconstructed from the jets and are shown to be well described by nlo

directly with a parton in the proton fig a or itmay п¬Ѓrst п¬‚uctuate into an hadronic state fig bin the п¬Ѓrst case known as the directcontribution the full energy of the photon participates in the interaction with a parton in theproton and the fraction of the photon momentum xОі participating in the hard process isequal to one the п¬Ѓnal state of the direct process consists of two jets the proton remnantand the scattered electron in the second case known as the resolved contribution the photonacts as a source of partons which then scatter oп¬Ђ partons in the proton and the fraction of thephoton momentum participating in the hard process is less than one the п¬Ѓnal state in thiscase includes a photon remnant continuing in the original photon direction in addition to twojets the proton remnant and the scattered electron at higher orders this simple distinctionbetween direct and resolved is no longer precisely deп¬Ѓnedwith a cut on jet transverse energy of ejett   gev direct photon events probe the partondistributions in the proton down to xp     where xp is the fraction of the protonsmomentum entering into the hard process this process is directly sensitive to the gluondistribution in the proton and complements indirect extractions in the same xp range  usingthe measurement of f in deep inelastic scattering dis the xp values sampled by the resolvedphoton contribution are typically higher than those of the direct contribution lying in a regionwhere the proton parton distributions are constrained by dis data resolved photon processesare directly sensitive to the photon parton distributions particularly the gluon distribution inthe photon down xОі   this is not the case in the measurement of f Оі in ОіОі interactionsat e+e colliders where highly virtual photons are used to probe almost real photons  incollisions between two almost real photons however the measurement of jet cross sections hasrecently shown potential to constrain the gluon distribution in the photon  in this paper we separate the direct and resolved photon contributions to jet production andpresent dijet diп¬Ђerential ep cross sections which are sensitive to the gluon distributions in theproton and photon respectivelyin describing the cross sections to be measured particularattention is paid to the way in which direct and resolved processes are deп¬Ѓned diп¬Ђerential epcross sections are presented as a function of jet pseudorapidity for direct and resolved photonprocesses and compared to available lo qcd calculations deп¬Ѓnition of cross sectionswe measure the cross section for dijet photoproduction ep  eОі p  e x for events in whichx contains at least two jets of ejett   gev in this experiment photoproduction events aredeп¬Ѓned by demanding that the electron is scattered at small angles and does not emerge fromthe beam pipe this requirement corresponds approximately to a cut of q   gev givinga median q of   gev  the cross section

central jets fromthese investigations we conclude that the monte carlo description of the energy response ofthe calorimeter to jets of hadrons is correct to within a possible overestimation of the energyof the eп¬Ђects of discrepancies between the monte carlo simulations and the data on the measurement of the cross sections are estimated by varying the selection cuts made on the reconstructedkinematic variables both in the data and the simulated sample and are included in the systematic errors on the п¬Ѓnal cross section values results and discussionfig a shows the distribution of xcalfor the п¬Ѓnal data sample entering into the cross sectionОіmeasurements there is a clear peak at high values of xcalОі which indicates the presence ofdirect type processes the shape of this uncorrected xobsdistribution and the position of thepeak are insensitive to the problem of calorimeter energy response because of the presence ofenergy terms in both the numerator and denominator of equation  the distributions frompythia and herwig are also shown where the monte carlo curves have been normalised toп¬Ѓt the direct peak in the data although the shape of the direct peak is reasonably reproducedthe monte carlo simulations fail to describe the rise seen in the data at low xcalОі  this eп¬Ђect wasalso seen in  in the same fig the lo direct contribution from herwig

with xloОі   is included in the calculations using thegs  photon parton distribution set this contribution to the lo cross section is smalldПѓdО·   nb this is also the case using other available photon parton distributionsets except for the lac set  where due to the high gluon density at high xlothecross section becomes large enough to describe the whole high xobscross section withoutany direct component this parton distribution set is disfavoured by results presented inthis paper see below and by other measurements ОіОі qcd calculations of this cross section are only available at lo some estimate of the sizeof higher order corrections can be made by comparing the lo calculation using the grvlo parton distribution set with the other lo calculations using nlo parton distributionsets which in general are around  lower in addition using ejetfor the hard scaletinstead of ejett  lowers the cross section by up to  when both jets are at equal О·t  and equal ejetin the theoretical curves the description of the measured points by the theoretical curves isreasonable the eп¬Ђects of kt  hadronisation and of using diп¬Ђerent parton distributions are ofcomparable

as for the directmeasurement the purity depends mostly on migrations across the ejetcut no subtractiontof jet pedestal energy is carried out however variations in the kinematic selection of theanalysis now give systematic variations in the cross section which are larger than the statisticalerrors and thus the systematic error bars are correspondingly larger as was seen in fig cboth monte carlo simulations fail to describe the forward region of the transverse energy п¬‚owaround the jet axis and a reduction of these systematic uncertainties will require improvementsin the simulations used in fig  the correlated uncertainty arising from the description of thecalorimeter energy response in the monte carlo is again shown separately by the shaded bandthe band also includes the  uncertainty in the measurement of the integrated luminositythe shaded band represents the width of the uncertainty around each data pointtable  and fig  shows the measured cross section dПѓdО· for

calculated usingdiп¬Ђerent photon parton distribution sets and the mrsa set for the proton the theoreticalsensitivity to the parton distributions in the proton is small not shown with the variationsbetween curves calculated using diп¬Ђerent parton distribution sets being much less than theestimated errors on the measured cross section as xp is higher in these events than in thedirect the eп¬Ђect of kt from partons in the proton on this calculation is expected to be smallthe dg  grv lo and gs parton distribution sets reproduce the shape of the cross sectionwell and can be brought into agreement with the data by applying a multiplicative factor of to  note that the available nlo calculations  for inclusive jet photoproduction which isdominated by the resolved process diп¬Ђer

photonprotoncentre of mass cmenergies an order of magnitude larger than in previous п¬Ѓxed targetexperimentsthe majority of the Оіp collisions are due to interactions of the proton with the hadronicstructure of the photon a process that has been successfully described by the vector mesondominance model vdm here the photon is pictured to п¬‚uctuate into a virtual vectormeson that subsequently collides with the proton such collisions exhibit the phenomenologicalcharacteristics of hadronhadron interactionsin particular they can proceed via diп¬Ђractiveor nondiп¬Ђractive channels the diп¬Ђractive interactions are characterized by very small fourmomentum transfers and no colour exchange between the colliding particles leading to п¬Ѓnalstates where the colliding particles appear either intact or as more massive dissociated stateshowever it has been previously demonstrated that photoproduction collisions at high transversemomentum cannot be described solely in terms of the п¬‚uctuation of the photon into a hadronlike state   the deviations come from contributions of two additional processes called directand anomalous in the former process the photon couples directly to the charged partons insidethe proton the anomalous component corresponds to the process where the photon couplesto a qq pair without forming a bound state the interactions of the photon via the hadronlikestate and the anomalous component are referred to as resolved photoproduction since both ofthem can be described in terms of the partonic structure of the photon in this paper we present the measurement of the transverse momentum spectra of chargedparticles produced in photoproduction reactions at an average cm energy of hwi   gevand in the laboratory pseudorapidity range   О·    this range approximatelycorresponds to the cm pseudorapidity interval of   О·cm   where the direction isdeп¬Ѓned such that positive О·cm values correspond to the photon fragmentation region thetransverse

reaction Оіp  xp where x results from the dissociation of the photon waspreviously measured by the e fermilab experiment at much lower cm energies  w   gev  it was demonstrated that the properties of the diп¬Ђractive excitation of thephoton resemble diп¬Ђraction of hadrons in terms of the distribution of the dissociated mass thedistribution of the fourmomentum transfer between the colliding

inaccuracy is the tracking system and its simulationin the monte carlo events used for the acceptance correction using an alternative simulationcode with artiп¬Ѓcially degraded tracking performance we

of events observed but would not aп¬Ђect the п¬Ѓnal pt spectra since it is normalizedto the number of events the correlation between the rcal energy and the pt of tracks isvery smallto evaluate the

the п¬Ѓt yielded    signal events monte carlo simulation and acceptanceelastic jП€ production was simulated with the dipsi and the epjpsi generators themodel used by dipsi assumes that the exchanged photon п¬‚uctuates into a qq pair which theninteracts with the proton via the exchange of a pomeron described in terms of a gluon ladderthe model is based on a perturbative qcd calculation in the leading log approximation thehard scale in this model is taken to be Вµ  m jП€   gev the gluon momentumdensity of the proton used as input in the dipsi monte carlo was  x the epjpsigenerator assumes pomeron exchange for the elastic jП€ production two diп¬Ђerent models ofthe pomeron were used in the п¬Ѓrst model the pomeron consists of two gluons and one of thegluons interacts with the cc state into which the photon has п¬‚uctuated the jП€ is formed fromthe cc and the remaining gluon of the pomeron in the second model the pomeron is withouta structure and it interacts with the photon as a whole to form the jП€events were generated in the w range between  and  gev and between the minimumallowed value of q   gev and  gev the events were then passed through thestandard zeus detector and trigger simulation programs and processed with the same reconstruction and analysis programs as the data the distributions of the reconstructed kinematicquantities obtained using dipsi were in good agreement with those from the data the overallacceptance including the geometric acceptance detector trigger and reconstruction eп¬ѓciencies was then obtained using dipsi as the ratio of the number of accepted monte carlo eventsto the number generated in the selected kinematic range of w between  and  gev eventsgenerated with epjpsi reproduced some aspects of the data well and were used in the studyof systematic uncertainties in the acceptance determination table  shows the acceptancesin various w ranges determined for each decay mode backgroundtwo types of background contributions were considered the п¬Ѓrst is a continuum backgroundpresent over the complete mass range which was already subtracted in obtaining the numberof signal events from the п¬Ѓt the second type is jП€ production through proton dissociation orother inelastic production processes continuum background the betheheitler process produces lepton pairs from photonphotonscattering where the electron and the proton each radiates a photon the invariant mass spectrum of the lepton pair either e+eor Вµ+Вµ typically forms a continuum with a maximum atlow masses the contribution from this process was obtained by generating monte carlo eventsusing the generator lpair these events were treated the same way as those generatedby dipsi the hatched regions in fig a and b show the lpair events normalized to theappropriate ep luminosity which survived all the selection criteria in the mass region between and  gev the background from this process in each mode is  for the electron decay mode a second source of continuum background was responsible for thediп¬Ђerence between the quadratic polynomial dashed curve and the two photon process shownin fig a hatched area after studies with data and monte carlo this was determined to befrom pion contamination one or both of the electron candidates could be misidentiп¬Ѓed pionsthe probability of misidentiп¬Ѓcation decreases with increasing momentum in the mass rangebetween  and  gev the background from the pion contamination is comparable to that fromthe twophoton process the proton dissociation process in reactions like ep  e jП€ x where x was undetectedcan also contribute to the observed jП€ signal as the outgoing proton is not observed thisbackground was estimated by removing the criterion that the energy deposited in cal excluding that from the jП€ decay leptons be less than  gev a total of four events in theelectron mode and three events in the muon mode were observed with cal close to the protondirection these are candidates for jП€ production accompanied by proton dissociation montecarlo events simulating this process were generated with pythia the mass distributionn where n was varied beof the diп¬Ђractive system x was parametrised as dПѓdmxtween  and  these monte carlo events were analysed in the same way as the data forn   the proton dissociative contamination in the jП€ signal was estimated to be  bycomparing the number of events with extra energy in cal from this monte carlo sample withthe seven events from the data the fraction of proton dissociative contamination determinedwas +   where the п¬Ѓrst uncertainty is statistical obtained from the electron and themuon modes together and the second uncertainty is systematic observed from the variationof n between  and  in the monte carlo the cross section for the elastic process was thusobtained by subtracting  from the jП€ signal independent of w   mx the contribution from the photongluon fusion process was determined from monte carlostudies using herwig and epjpsi possible contributions from П€ productionand processes where the photon undergoes diп¬Ђractive dissociation eg Оі  jП€ x where xwas not detected were also considered the total

    "text": "introductionhard scattering between a real photon and a proton is expected in lowest order qcd tooccur by two diп¬Ђerent mechanisms fig  the photon may interact directly with a quarkor gluon from the proton or it may resolve into its constituent quarks and gluons which theninteract with the partons from the proton these two processes are called direct and resolvedphotoproduction respectively in direct photoproduction the entire photon participates in the hard scatter in resolved photoproduction on the other hand only a fraction of the momentum of the photon is involved inthe hard scatter while the remaining momentum is carried by spectator partons these partons fragment into a photon remnant which is expected to be approximately collinear with theoriginal photon the presence of resolved photon interactions at hera has been demonstrated  and the existence of the photon remnant has been conп¬Ѓrmed the separation betweenthe direct and resolved contributions has also been reported together with the measurementof a diп¬Ђerential dijet cross section  inclusive jet   and dijet  cross sections have givenfurther information on the kinematic properties of these two processes and on the gluon contentof the proton as well as on the parton structure of the photonthe presence of a photon remnant in photonproton collisions has been used as a means toidentify resolved photoproduction interactions the study of the photon remnant itself however is also interesting a detailed comparison with leadingorder lo predictions has notbeen performed and little is known about the internal structure of the photon remnant onthe theoretical side although the pointlike coupling of the photon to quarkantiquark pairs isincluded in parameterizations of the photon structure function most monte carlo simulationsmodel the resolved photon as a hadron with collinear incoming partons this results in a photon remnant with lowpt with respect to the beam axis several studies have suggested thatnexttoleadingorder contributions or п¬‚uctuations of the photon into quarkantiquark pairswith high virtuality may lead to a photon remnant which has sizable transverse momentumwith respect to the incident photon direction   in this paper the photon remnant is isolated for the п¬Ѓrst time its properties are studied usinga clustering algorithm and are found to be consistent with those commonly attributed to jetsthese remnant jets are then compared with the jets emerging from the hard interaction andwith lo monte carlo expectations the data were collected with the zeus detector duringthe  datataking period the study is conducted for Оіp centreofmass energies wОіp inthe range   wОіp   gev experimental setupdetails of the zeus detector have been described elsewhere  the primary componentsused in this analysis are the calorimeter and the tracking detectors the uraniumscintillatorcalorimeter  covers  of the total solid angleit is subdivided into electromagneticand hadronic sections with cell sizes of    cm    cm in the outgoing electrondirection and    cm respectivelyit consists of three parts the rear calorimeterrcal covering the region   О·   the barrel calorimeter bcal covering theregion   О·   and the forward calorimeter fcal covering the region   О·  the calorimeter has an energy resolution achieved in test beams of Пѓe   qof the bjorkenyyj b Пѓiei  pizin this region and to the low transverse energy a cone algorithm cannot be used to identifythe photon remnant therefore we chose to use the k clustering algorithm  the analysiswas done in the laboratory frame instead of the Оіp frame due to the uncertainties in the boostthe k algorithm п¬Ѓnds jets by iteratively merging clustersinitially clusters are individualcalorimeter cells for the monte carlo events the algorithm is also used to cluster generatedparticles see section  in the merging procedure the quantity k is evaluated for each pairof clustersk  e min  cosОёnmwhere Оёnm is the angle between the two clusters n and m and emin is the minimum valueof the cluster energies en and emin the small angle approximation k is the transversemomentum squared of the lower energy cluster with respect to the higher energy cluster apseudoparticle with inп¬Ѓnite momentum along the z axis is included in the clustering procedureto take the proton remnant into account the value of k between the pseudoparticle and theother clusters is calculated using the same formula as above when all of the k values havebeen calculated the two clusters with the lowest k value are merged the fourmomentum ofthe new cluster is the sum of the fourmomenta of the two merged clusters the calculationof k is then repeated replacing the two merged clusters with the new cluster the iterationcontinues until the energyangle resolution variable y y  ke t  where et is the total eventenergy transverse to the beam axis becomes larger than some threshold ycut the value ofycut may be п¬Ѓxed or chosen on an eventbyevent basis for high transverse energy jets thek clusterп¬Ѓnding algorithm gives results which are similar to those obtained with the conealgorithm photon remnant identiп¬Ѓcationto identify the photon remnant we begin with an intuitive approach which is later justiп¬Ѓedusing simulated events as illustrated by fig b resolved hard photoproduction events have aп¬Ѓnal state which includes two high pt jets from the hard scatter as well as photon and protonremnants since we expect to п¬Ѓnd three clusters in addition to the proton remnant in eachevent we choose the value of ycut on an eventbyevent basis so that three clusters are found ineach event  these three clusters then should correspond to the two clusters from the hardscatter and the photon remnant since the photon remnant is expected to have low transversemomentum with respect to the beam axis the separation between the photon remnant and thetwo jets from the hard scatter can be achieved to a п¬Ѓrst approximation by associating thephoton remnant with the cluster having the smallest transverse momentum for direct eventswhere we do not expect to see a photon remnant the lowest transverse momentum cluster willeither be part of the proton remnant or part of one of the two high transverse momentum jetstherefore the pseudorapidity distributions of the lowest transverse momentum clusters will bediп¬Ђerent for resolved and direct eventsin fig ac we show the uncorrected pseudorapidity distributions of the three clusters obtained with the k algorithm the data full circles and monte carlo events histogram arecal figshown normalized in the region О·cal   while the two clusters with the highest ptab are mostly found in the О·cal   region the third cluster with the lowest ptcal fig cis observed mostly in the О·cal   region ie in the photon direction data and monte carlocal clusters except in the forward region О·cal  expectations agree for the two highest ptwhere we observe in the data an excess similar to that already reported in our previous anal  cal clusters stem from the partonscal clusterscal clusters havecal   gev and that they are well separated from the forwardyses   the peak observed in fig c for the third cluster in the negative pseudorapidityregion is accounted for by the monte carlo simulation including resolved and direct processesfull histogram the monte carlo distribution however is shifted slightly to lower valuesthe direct process which does not contain a photon remnant does not contribute to this peakas shown by the dashed line in the п¬Ѓgure therefore we are justiп¬Ѓed in using this method toseparate direct and resolved events in addition the third cluster when it is in the negativepseudorapidity region can be associated with the photon remnantin order to maximize the possibility that the two highest ptin the hard scatter and to minimize the possibility that one of the two highest ptis in fact part of the proton remnant we require that the two highest pthigh transverse momentum ptregion О·calthe distribution of the pseudorapidity of the third cluster О·cal  after the above cuts and therequirement ecal   gev is shown in fig d the comparison with the distribution predictedfor direct processes shows that the events with О·cal   are almost exclusively due to resolvedprocesses the agreement of the monte carlo simulation for resolved plus direct contributionswith the data is not perfect in the data there are somewhat fewer events with large negativeО·cal values the diп¬Ђerence between the data and the monte carlo simulation is not improvedwhen the photon parton parameterization lac dotted line is used instead of grv lo forthe following analysis the resolved event sample is selected by requiring О·cala measurement of the mean value of ycut also demonstrates the diп¬Ђerence between the twoevent samples on either side of О·cal   higher values of ycut indicate energetic clusterswhich are spatially well separated for the events at high О·cal  the mean value of ycut is for the low О·calevents the mean value of ycut is  this result suggests that the high О·calevents contain a signiп¬Ѓcant number of direct twojet events for which the clustering procedurehas been prematurely stopped for the sample at О·cal   however the separation betweenthe three clusters is quite distincta total of  events satisfy the cuts for these

direct events in this sampleas events with xОі    we obtain a contribution from direct processes of about  thecontribution from direct photon interactions estimated using lo direct monte carlo events isalso    correction procedurein the following the data are corrected back to the hadron level using the pythia montecarlo program previously described for the monte carlo events the k algorithm is appliedindependently at both the generated hadron level and the calorimeter cell level in both casesthe resulting clusters are sorted according to pt  the detector level cuts in О·cal ptcal ecal and yjb correspond approximately to two hadron jets with pt    gev and О·   aremnant cluster with О·   and e   gev and   y   therefore the hadronlevel monte carlo distributions were determined for events within this kinematic regionthe correspondence between hadron and calorimeter clusters was determined by comparingthe value of k for each pair of hadron and calorimeter clusters each hadron cluster was thenmatched with that calorimeter cluster with which it had the lowest value of k after all cutswere applied at both the hadron and calorimeter levels and neglecting the possible interchangeof the labels cluster  and cluster  due to the sorting this occurs in events in which thetwo highest pt jets have similar pt  all three clusters were found to be correctly matched for of the events for  of the events a highpt cluster at one level was associated with theproton remnant at the other level in less than  of the events the lowest pt clusters at thehadron and calorimeter levels were not matchedthe experimental shifts and resolutions of the measured variables were evaluated using thematched hadron and calorimeter clusters the average measured value of О· is shifted withrespect to the hadron level by less than + and has a resolution of  unitsfor the п¬Ѓrst two jets third cluster the measured transverse jet momentum with respect tothe beam is reduced on average by  and has a resolution of  this is due either to themagnetic п¬Ѓeld acting on low energy particles or to dead material in the apparatus the valueof y is reconstructed with an average shift of  units and a resolution of  also due tolosses in the beam pipe and detector eп¬Ђectson average the third cluster contains    of the photon remnant energy as deп¬Ѓned bythe third cluster energy at the hadron level inactive material in front of the calorimeter resultsin an energy loss of about  independent of the cluster energy particles lost in the beampipe account for the rest of the energy loss this eп¬Ђect increases with cluster energy becomingcomparable to the detector eп¬Ђects at measured energies above  gevthe data were corrected with the following procedure first the contamination from eventsoutside the kinematic range was estimated using monte carlo events and was subtracted binbybin from the measured distributions the resulting distributions were then corrected with acorrelation matrix that was generated using the matched hadron and calorimeter clusters theunfolding procedure is described in  and includes acceptance corrections for the trigger andcuts described in section  the statistical errors were estimated by randomly varying withintheir statistical errors both the experimental data before the background subtraction andthe monte carlo correlation matrix and calculating the root mean squared deviation in eachbinthe systematic uncertainties were estimated by considering the following eп¬Ђects diп¬Ђerentphoton parton densities a  energy scale uncertainty in the monte carlo simulation of theenergy response of the calorimeter a variation of the cuts on the measured quantities yj bpt  corrections using the herwig monte carlo simulation an increase in thedirect cross section by a factor of three relative to the resolved one and the use of calorimeterislands see next section instead of cells for the herwig systematic study a fraction ofthe events was generated with Л†pt min set to  gev the systematic errors were evaluated bycalculating the root mean squared deviation between the original data point and each of thepoints found using the systematic variations mentioned above weighting each deviation by itsstatistical errors in the following п¬Ѓgures the statistical errors are shown as the inner error barsthe outer bars show the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature О·calcal О·cal photon remnant propertiesin fig  we show the pseudorapidity transverse momentum with respect to the z axisand energy distributions for the photon

   gevthe energy distribution fig c peaks around  gev and extends to  gev the solidhistogram shows the monte carlo expectation which agrees with the data except in the lowestbin where the monte carlo expectation is about  higherthe unlikely possibility has been studied that an incorrect monte carlo description of the energyresponse in the rcal might result in the observed discrepancy between the data and the montecarlo expectation the rcal energy scale was reduced by  within  of the rcal beampipe to simulate additional inactive material the discrepancy in the pt  distribution was notimproved and the disagreement with the data for the e distribution became worsethe observation that the average transverse momenta of the photon remnant is higher thanexpected from pythia is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions mentionedin the introduction therefore following  we have compared the data with monte carloevents generated with a harder intrinsic transverse momentum spectrum for the partons in thephoton ie dndk the pythia high kt results are shown as the dottedhistograms in fig  the parameter k is determined by minimizing the П‡ between the montecarlo hadron level and the corrected data pt  distributions the result is k    gev this corresponds to hkti   gev as compared to  gev for pythia with defaultparameters the agreement with the energy distribution is unchanged while it is considerablyimproved for the О· and pt  distributions on the other hand the distributions for the п¬Ѓrsttwo clusters remain unchanged not shown equally good agreement between the data andthe monte carlo simulation has been achieved by reweighting the monte carlo events to thedefault intrinsic kt spectrum not shown in this case k    gev much higher thanthe default value of k   gev assumed in pythia these results show that adjusting theintrinsic transverse momenta of the partons in the photon is a way to improve the agreementbetween the data and the monte carlo predictionsone of the wellknown properties of jets is that the average energy transverse to the jet axis islimited as the jet energy increases in general this results in an average energy transverse to thejet axis per particle heiti of the order of a few hundred mev in measuring this quantity forthe photon remnant we used calorimeter islands islands are groups of calorimeter cells moreclosely related to particles than individual calorimeter cells and therefore represent a betterchoice for this measurement the analysis performed with calorimeter cells provides an upperlimit on the systematic uncertainties of this measurement figure a shows the average value ofheiti versus the cluster energy for the third cluster both for the data after corrections and forthe monte carlo simulation the corrections include the eп¬Ђect of particles lost down the beampipe the largest component of the systematic errors + comes from using calorimetercells instead of islandsthe mean value of heiti starts below  mev and slowly increases with the remnant energye the total cluster energy on the other hand spans a range from  to  gev thisresult demonstrates that the photon remnant exhibits limited transverse energy per particleas expected for jetlike objects further support to this conclusion is given in fig b whichshows the average values of the corrected total transverse Пѓieit  and total longitudinal Пѓieilenergy of the third cluster with respect to the cluster axis as a function of the energy of thecluster the longitudinal component increases much faster than the transverse energy andmost of the cluster energy is along the cluster axis this is consistent with a jetlike structureof the photon remnantwe also studied how the energy is distributed around the axis of the third cluster figurec shows the corrected energy п¬‚ow of the third cluster as a function of   cosОё for boththe data and the monte carlo simulation here Оё is the angle of the particle with respectto the cluster axis this is eп¬Ђectively a plot of the energy deposited in rings of п¬Ѓxed areacentred on the cluster axis because there is not a simple correspondence between particles andcalorimeter cells it is diп¬ѓcult to construct a correlation matrix between the generated hadronenergy and experimental calorimeter cell energy quantities therefore these distributionsare corrected binbybin the average correction factor is around  in fig c we haverequired reconstructed uncorrected jet energies between  and  gev and hadron level jetenergies between  and  gev the statistical errors are the error on the mean the energydistribution for the data is quite collimated the monte carlo simulation agrees very well withthe data indicating that the fragmentation of the remnant is understood comparison of the photon remnant with jets fromhard scatteringhaving established the jetlike properties of the photon remnant we next compare it with thejets originating from parton hard scattering the comparison of these two types of jets is ofinterest because one is the debris of the photon and is a lowpt jet with pt typically well below gev while the other two jets come from the hard scattering of the partons in the photonand proton and are highpt jets with a minimum pt of  gev a comparison between lowptand highpt jets has been proposed as a method of studying the hadronization process ti hПѓieifigures d e and f present the results of this comparison for the average value of heitiand hПѓieili and cosОё respectively in fig f we again require reconstructed uncorrectedjet energies between  and  gev and hadron level jet energies between  and  gev this cutis especially important for this п¬Ѓgure in order to compare jets with approximately equal energiesin all п¬Ѓgures good agreement between the third cluster and the two hard jets is observed fromthese comparisons we conclude that in the kinematic region and for the variables studied thelowpt photon remnant jet exhibits the same hadronization characteristics as the highpt jetsoriginating from the hard scattering process conclusionsfor the п¬Ѓrst time in a sample of quasireal photonproton collisions the photon remnantproduced in resolved photon interactions has been isolated the selected events contain twohighpt jets with pt   gev and О·   and   wОіp   gev the properties of thephoton remnant as deп¬Ѓned by a cluster with О·   and e   gev are studied and shownto exhibit a collimated energy п¬‚ow with a limited transverse energy with respect to the clusteraxis characteristic of a jet structurethe leading order qcd monte carlo simulation with default parameters does not reproducethe pseudorapidity distribution or the transverse momentum distribution with respect to theincident photon of the photon remnant the mean value of pt for the photon remnant   gev is substantially larger than the monte carlo expectation better agreement canbe obtained by increasing the average intrinsic transverse momenta of the partons in the photonto about  gev these results are in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations ofsubstantial mean transverse momenta for the photon remnantthe photon remnant has also been compared in the laboratory frame with the two highptjets originating from the parton hard scattering although the origins of these two types of jetsmay be quite diп¬Ђerent within the present statistics and in the kinematic range studied theyexhibit similar properties for the energy п¬‚ow and the transverse and longitudinal energy withrespect to the jet axis

    "text": "introductionthe existence of phase transitions in nuclear matter was proposed more than years ago in conjunction with the description of the structure of neutron stars this led to the question whether phase separation  dynamical instabilities  orcritical phenomena  play a role in the disintegration of highly excited nuclei produced in proton or heavy ion induced collisions the observation of a power lawfor the fragment size distribution  was the п¬Ѓrst experimental hint for a secondorder phase transition but the determination of critical exponents  or other parameters  turned out to be diп¬ѓcult with the mostly inclusive data available atthat time  in the past  years however data from a new generation ofexperiments with an almost complete coverage for the decay products of an excited system allowed for rapid progress the observation of potential signals of aп¬Ѓrst order phase transition  and the attempt of a quantitative determinationof critical exponents  sparked an intense discussion on what reliable signaturesfor a п¬Ѓrst or second order phase transition in a small and dynamically evolvingsystem arein the following we will take the recent claim  that a continuous phasetransition with critical exponents consistent with those of a liquidgas systemhas been observed in the fragmentation of nuclei at face value and revisit thetheoretical arguments used

correction to scaling terms or a crossover approach the size of the critical regiondepends strongly on the exact form of the interaction and is rather small inreal liquids  but substantially larger in models with only nextneighbor orshort range interactions the leading correction term for the order parameterin the ising model  is not only substantially smaller in magnitude but haseven a diп¬Ђerent sign as compared to typical liquids  it is therefore uncertainwhether simple schematic models like percolation or ising are adequate forthe modeling of п¬Ѓnite size and п¬Ѓnite control parameter

    "text": "introductionthe study of ПЂnucleus elastic diп¬Ђerential scattering cross sections with incident pionenergy above  mev ie beyond the range of the п¬Ѓrst pionnucleon resonance has been motivated by several considerations because the wavelength of the pion is shorterat higher energies it can be a sensitive probe of spatial distributions in a nucleus the pionnucleon twobody interaction becomes weaker above resonance allowing the pion to penetratedeeper into the nucleus the twobody total cross section drops to  mb isospinaveragedat  mev about  of its value on the peak of the resonance in addition the smallertwobody cross section implies that secondorder corrections to п¬Ѓrstorder multiplescatteringoptical potentials should be small thus signiп¬Ѓcant diп¬Ђerences between the measured elasticcross sections and the п¬Ѓrstorder impulse approximation ia calculations especially atforward angles could signal the failure of the ia which would pose a number of interestingphysics questionsat energies above the  pion elastic diп¬Ђerential cross sections at  mevc weremeasured at bnl for c and ca  the data were in qualitative agreement with anumber of diп¬Ђerent calculations however the diп¬Ђerential cross sections at forward angleswere underpredicted by all of them  the  normalization error in the data aswell as some uncertainties in the input to the calculations caused diп¬ѓculty in pinpointingthe reasons for the discrepancy more recent pionnucleus data at  mev for si fromlampf  and for c at    and  mevc and pb at  mevc fromkek  are now available the overall agreement between theory and experiment isqualitative at best for c but is quite reasonable for pb as will be discussed below thediscrepancy at forward angles is less pronounced for these data than for the bnl data orthe present experimentin sec ii the experiment is described section iii brieп¬‚y discusses the four theoreticalcalculations which are compared with the present experimental data comparisons withprevious data are also given a summary is given in sec ivii experimentin this work we present elastic scattering data for ПЂ on c ca zr and pbat pion laboratory kinetic energies of  and  mev the data were taken at the losalamos meson physics facility at  mev one is still on the highenergy tail of the at  mev the pionnucleon centerofmass total energy is  mev which is near thep  the next resonance above the data were obtained using the p east channel at the clinton p anderson meson physicsfacility and the large acceptance spectrometer las the p channel provides a pionbeam produced by interactions of the  mev primary proton beam in the c productiontarget in the original design the pion beam was achromatic at the experimental targetie the mean momentum of the incident pions would not be correlated with position forthe purposes of this work a dispersed beam tune was developed in order to improve theresolution in the missing mass spectra with this tune the momentum dispersion at thetarget was cm the angle of incidence was also correlated with position at the targetthe energy spread of the incident pion beam was about  mev at the  mev settingand about  mev at the  mev settingthe outgoing pions were detected using a modiп¬Ѓed version of the argonne large acceptance spectrometer a qqd system four drift chamber planes measuring both horizontaland vertical positions and angles were located between the second quadrupole magnet andthe dipole magnet four wire chamber planes followed by two sets of scintillators were located after the analyzing dipole magnet all of the wire chambers were delaylinereadoutdrift chambers  in order to minimize coulomb multiple scattering and improve the momentum resolution helium bags were installed along the entire sixmeter distance from thetarget to the rear wire chambers the target was enclosed in a vacuum chamber and thin Вµm mylar windows were used on the wire chambers the apparatus included an additionalsweep magnet between the target and the spectrometer which was adjusted to bend thepaths of particles with the nominal momentum of the spectrometer setting by  in thehorizontal plane and to steer particles of the opposite charge away from the spectrometerthe acceptance of the spectrometer was  in scattering angle horizontally  in thevertical direction and  in ppthree beam monitors were used each supplying a relative measurement of the integratedcurrent for every run a toroidal counter located just downstream of the production targetmonitored the proton beam an ion chamber was located in the production target boxanother ion chamber was placed at the exit of the beam pipe with any п¬Ѓxed beam tunethe ratio of any two beammonitor readouts was constant within  the hardware triggerconsisted of a coincidence between any frontchamber signals with the two scintillators atthe end of the spectrometer the target thicknesses were  mgcm for ch  mgcmfor c  mgcm for ca  mgcm for zr and  mgcm for pb the nominaltarget thickness error is  for each target the zr and pb targets were enrichedin isotopic purity to greater than  and the c and ca targets were of natural isotopicabundancethe scattered pion momentum the coordinates and angles at the target location werecalculated using taylor series expansions about the central trajectory through the spectrometer in addition redundancy checks we measured four positions and four angles todescribe trajectories given by two positions two angles and one momentum were calculated as diп¬Ђerences between the measured rear angles and rear angles calculated using allcoordinate information excluding the rear angle measurements the polynomial coeп¬ѓcientsfor the target positions were calibrated by using horizontal and vertical rod targets coeп¬ѓcients for the angle calculations were obtained by using the beam at reduced intensity andchanging the angle by moving the spectrometer around zero degrees the coeп¬ѓcients forthe momentum calculation were obtained by scanning an elastic peak across the focal planeof the spectrometerthe beam momentumposition correlation at the target was directly measured usingdata taken with a heavy target pb for which п¬Ѓnite angular resolution eп¬Ђects on themissing mass spectra are small since the recoil energies are insigniп¬Ѓcant compared to thescattered pion kinetic energy the resulting width for the elastic peak in the missing massspectra of the heavier targets was as small as  mev for beam energies of  mevthe calculation of missing mass include the recoil energy with scattering angle measuredin the spectrometer the eп¬Ђect of a correlation in the beam direction with target positionon the scattering angle was included in this calculation these eп¬Ђects are important forscattering from hydrogen because of the large variation in kinetic energy with scatteringangle of more than  mevdeg at large angles the п¬Ѓnite angular resolution due to bothangular dispersion in the beam and the resolution of the angle determination in the spectrometer limited the missing mass resolution for hydrogen by comparing the width of thepb elastic peak with the corresponding elastic peak for hydrogen at the same scatteringangle we obtained a direct measure of our angular resolution which was  fwhmthe measurement of position and angles both before and after the spectrometer dipoleprovided a useful capability for rejecting particles that underwent collisions or decay downstream from the target the rear angles were calculated as a polynomial of front positionsfront angles and momentum the diп¬Ђerence between the calculated and measured anglewas typically about  mrad good events were selected with a cut on this quantity of mrada combination of pulseheight and timeofп¬‚ight information from the scintillators wasused to reject proton events figure  shows the separation of proton events from thoseof lighter particles in a twodimensional histogram of the time of п¬‚ight vs the geometricmean of the heights of the pulses coming from the two scintillators this technique was notable to distinguish pions from electrons and muons electrons were eliminated by using acherenkov counter in the focal plane and muons due to pion decays in the spectrometer wereeliminated by the angle checks the fraction of events due to muons elastically scattered inthe target is estimated to be smaller than  figure  shows typical missingmass spectra at tПЂ   mev and Оёlab   averagedover  typically there are several peaks in each missingmass histogram corresponding tothe ground state and several excited states of the target nucleus we п¬Ѓtted each histogramwith a gaussian peak shape the overlap between the groundstate peak and the inelasticpeaks was usually small since the resolution was  mev fwhm at tПЂ   mev andabout  mev fwhm at  meveach set of data was partitioned into  bins in the angle of scattering in lab coordinatesin each experimental run iefor each spectrometer setting target incomingenergy and pion polarity we recorded data that spanned  bins we incremented theangle of the spectrometer settings by  so that any two adjacent settings had п¬Ѓve bins incommonthe uncertainty in the absolute scattering angle was estimated to be  deg whicharises from the uncertainty in the absolute zero degree scattering position  deg andthe locations of the survey marks on the п¬‚oor  deg for the spectrometer angle settingsthe absolute scattering angles were determined to  deg by placing the spectrometerin the beam and by measuring the energy diп¬Ђerence between the elastic peaks for pionscattering from h and pb and using kinematics to determine the scattering anglethe normalization involved two stages first we found each bins relative normalization referred to as the relative component of acceptance with respect to all other binsfor the same beam tune and target dimensions the height of the zr target was smallerthan the rest of the targets so we used a separate normalization for those runs this relative normalization was п¬Ѓxed for given target dimensions and beam tune regardless of thespectrometer angle then for each beam tune and target shape we determined an overallnormalization such that ПЂ  p scattering data from ch matched the arndt partialwave п¬Ѓtto the corresponding pionnucleon cross section the relative component of the acceptance of each run was treated as a function of twovariables the momentum of the particle more precisely the fractional deviation from thenominal setting of the spectrometer and the bin number with п¬Ѓxed beam tune andtarget dimensions this function was п¬Ѓxed independent of target material or spectrometerangle the dependence of the relative component of acceptance of each bin on momentumwas found by varying the momentum setting of the spectrometer and comparing yieldsthe dependence on the bin number was found by comparing yields at the same angle inseveral overlapping runs the latter method was complemented by a trial adjustment ofthe  relative bin acceptances so that the resulting cross sections smoothly matched aswell as possible in П‡ to a high order polynomial order  to  worked best the п¬Ѓttinginvolved data from several targets and resulted in no signiп¬Ѓcant modiп¬Ѓcation of the previousacceptance coeп¬ѓcients the relative normalization procedure proved quite robust when thestatistics were adequatethe overall normalization uncertainty in this experiment is  this error arises fromseveral components  in the target thickness which is counted twice since it applies tothe normalization targets as well  in each overall normalization coeп¬ѓcient  in thebeam count  in the isotopic purity  in each bins relative normalization coeп¬ѓcientan estimated  arising from the systematic error we describe next and an uncertainty of at most in determining the eп¬ѓciency of the detection setupthe only signiп¬Ѓcant systematic error in this experiment arises from treating the relativecomponent of the acceptance of each bin as a function of two variables only while there wasindication of a small dependence upon at least another variable that might be for instancea target coordinate but our statistical sample was inadequate for taking that eп¬Ђect intoaccount instead we have estimated its contribution to the overall uncertaintyiii discussion and analysisthe present experimental elastic diп¬Ђerential cross sections are compared with four diп¬Ђerent theoretical п¬Ѓrstorder ia calculations all have been used previously to investigate pionand kaon nucleus elastic scattering the п¬Ѓrst model discussed is based on the relativisticimpulse approximation ria which has been used with success in describing protonnucleusscattering  for the scattering of spin zero mesons the kemmerduп¬ѓnpetiau kdpequation  rather than the dirac equation is used this kdpria approach has beenused to obtain optical potentials for both kaonnucleus and pionnucleus elastic scattering  the construction of the lorentz scalar and vector optical potentials parallelsthat of the usual ria the twobody input consists of scalar and vector neutron and protonmeanп¬Ѓeld hartree densities  and the empirical mesonnucleon arndt amplitudes these calculations are shown by solid lines in figs  through  as in the dirac casethe scalar and vector potentials are large and tend to cancel these optical potentials alongwith the coulomb potential obtained from the empirical charge distribution from electronscattering are used in the secondorder kdp wave equation which is solved by partial waveanalysis to get the elastic scattering diп¬Ђerential cross sections a nonrelativistic impulseapproximation nria optical potential is also obtained using the same arndt amplitudesand the same vector neutron and proton meanп¬Ѓeld hartree densities see ref  theseresults are given by the dotted lines in figs  through  these optical potentials alongwith the coulomb potential are used in the schrodinger equation and the observables areobtained by partial wave analysis both calculations include the eп¬Ђect of folding over the fwhm angular resolution uncertaintyas mentioned above although the scalar and vector potentials are very large in somecases over  mev at the origin the resulting eп¬Ђective central potentials are modest insize in fig  we show the kdpria real and imaginary potentials for pbПЂ ПЂ at  and  mev the nria potentials are also shown for  mev the imaginary centralpotentials are remarkably energy independent this is true for all of the targets consideredin this work the values of the volume integral per nucleon ja are between  and mevfm for all targets and energies the real central potentials exhibit more energydependence but they are always repulsive in this energy range it is of interest to compare the two models above with results from the more completemomentumspace multiplescattering optical potential rompin developed by chen ernstand johnson  these authors have obtained a п¬Ѓrstorder optical potential which usescovariant kinematics phasespace factors and normalizations oп¬Ђshell twobody amplitudesand exact fermiaveraging integrals the momentumspace optical potential is used in akleingordon equation and the diп¬Ђerential cross sections are obtained the results of therompin calculations are shown by dashed lines in figs  through in addition theauthors of ref  have developed an eikonal model for comparison with their modelexact calculation the eikonal calculations are given by the dotdashed curves in figs through  both the momentumspace optical and eikonal models use the same onshell pionamplitudes  and the same hartreefock wave functions  which have been correctedfor centerofmass motion both calculations have been folded over the  fwhm angularresolution uncertaintythe п¬Ѓrst observation is that all of these four calculations agree with each other to within at small angles the noticeable diп¬Ђerences at larger angles could reasonably beattributed to diп¬Ђerences in the nuclear structure input the diп¬Ђerences in the construction ofthe optical potentials and the diп¬Ђerent onebody equations used other explanations areof course possible the calculations generally agree better with each other than they dowith the data this is especially true as the target mass increases the diп¬Ђerence betweenthe measured small angle diп¬Ђerential cross sections and the calculated values is pronouncedfor all targets at both energies though it is diп¬ѓcult to see this clearly on the logscale ofthe п¬Ѓgures  in addition there is a systematic diп¬Ђerence between theory and experimentregarding the position of the п¬Ѓrst diп¬Ђraction minimain every case the п¬Ѓrst minima forboth the kdpria and the rompin calculations occur at angles which are  to larger than the corresponding minima in the data in a similar analysis of the  mevsiПЂ ПЂ lampf data the position of the diп¬Ђraction dip is in much better agreementwith experiment than evidenced here for any of the targets  both of these features willbe discussed again when comparisons with other experimental data are givenin fig  the kek bnl and lampf cПЂ ПЂ diп¬Ђerential cross sections are plottedas a function of the momentum transfer q because all four of the calculations describedabove agree with each other at forward angles ie up to the п¬Ѓrst diп¬Ђraction minima onlythe kdpria calculations are shown the calculations agree with the forward angle crosssections to within the normalization errors except for the  mevc bnl data and the and  mev lampf data in every case except for the  mevc kek data thediп¬Ђraction minima in the kdpria calculations occur at angles about  to  largerthan the minima in the data in these calculations recoil is not taken into account howeverthe rompin calculations do address the question of recoil and as is shown in fig  therompin and kdpria dip positions agree to within  so the reason for the discrepancyis not clear the results for cПЂ+ ПЂ+ at  and  mev and  mevc shown in fig also indicate a similar result regarding the position of the diп¬Ђraction minima the calculatedsmall angle cross sections for  mevc underpredict the bnl data but overpredict thelampf datafigures  and  compare the caПЂ ПЂ bnl results with those of the presentexperiment the underprediction of the small angle bnl data is evident however thepositions of the diп¬Ђraction minima are well reproduced by the calculations in disagreementwith the results for the current experiment where the minima are shifted of course it ispossible to п¬Ѓt the  and  mev data by a simple twoparameter scaling of the potentialsbut this does not give much insight into the origin of the discrepancy figures  and show the results for pbПЂ ПЂ the higher energy data at  mevc  mev arefrom kek  the disagreement between the present experiment and the calculationsis profound while agreement with the kek data is reasonable the  uncertainty inthe elementary amplitudes does not result in calculated cross sections which resolve thediscrepancy  using more recent determinations of the relativistic meanп¬Ѓeld hartreedensities which incorporate nonlinear chiral symmetry and broken scale invariance  donot change the results  referring to the central potentials shown in fig  does notreveal any anomalous behaviour with energy it is possible that some of this discrepancymay be accounted for by the absolute angle uncertainty  in the data but not all of itat this time a full understanding of the source of the diп¬Ђraction minima angle discrepancyis not availableiv summarypionnucleus elastic scattering at energies above the  resonance has been studiedusing both ПЂ+ and ПЂ beams on c ca zr and pb targets these new data werecompared with other data sets at similar energies and with four theoretical calculations certain aspects of the predictions are in qualitative agreement with the data however signiп¬Ѓcantdisagreements are seen particularly in the angular positions of the diп¬Ђractive minima whichare generally not evidenced in comparisons with other experiments this is particularly truefor zr and pb the cause of these discrepancies has not yet been identiп¬Ѓed and maywait until other experiments using heavy targets become available in this energy

    "text": "introductionin order to describe the evolution of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions theorists mainly employ two types of models on the one hand there are cascadetype calculations such as rqmd arc or art except for the casewhen mean п¬Ѓeld eп¬Ђects are explicitly included into the calculations these codesdo not contain any collectivity on the other hand there are hydrodynamical models     that do not yet attempt to describe the hadronizationphase of the collision but provide an insight into the collective expansion ofa nuclear п¬‚uid with a given equation of state both types of codes have beensuccessfully applied to describe selected sets of experimental data while it isagreed that the hadronic freezeout obstructs the view into the early stage ofthe collision some of the models predict a distinct minimum in the sidewardп¬‚ow as a function of bombarding energy if a phase transition to the quarkgluon plasma qgp is assumed another interesting prediction is that as thebombarding energy is raised there will be a point softest point at whichthe pressure over energy density will reach a minimum at the phase transitionand the system will develop a maximum in the collective radial п¬‚ow here i would like to review some of the recent experimental advances madeat the ags in terms of the observation of collective п¬‚ow measurements ofthe e collaboration in particular of the reaction plane will be presentedin some detail and results from other collaborations e e e willbe used where appropriate event by event reconstruction of the reaction planethe п¬Ѓrst evidence for the presence of collective motion at ags energies aboutagevc was found in the systematic study of the transverse energy carriedper charged particle as a function of the mass of the collision system asthe system size increases the transverse energy per charged particle increasesdrastically shortly after this evidence for sideward п¬‚ow was found througha fourier analysis of the

nucleonsin raising the beam energy the sign of v changes and isnow more sensitive to the high initial pressure in the collision whetherthis trend continues at the sps as shown in the п¬Ѓgure is not completely clearyet since the data from na does not allow for the reconstruction ofthe reaction plane and therefore the sign of v has not been veriп¬Ѓed alsothe magnitude depends on the assumption that pions contribute mostly tothe measured signal and that for them transverse momentum and transverseenergy are similar outlookwith the advent of very detailed datasets it should п¬Ѓnally be possible todetermine some of the fundamental thermal and hydrodynamical properties ofhighly excited nuclear matter and to discern some of the models that try todescribe it at sps energies п¬Ѓrst direct hints of the elusive qgp have beenreported through the measurement of dielectrons and dimuons on thehadronic side this is corroborated by the п¬Ѓndings of the freezeout temperatureat the phase

known manyyears however even in the continuous case there was some diп¬ѓculcy inп¬Ѓnding the canonically adjoint darboux basis following the ostrogradski transformation for the vectorvalued higher order variational problemsbdeconinck pointed this out to me we dont try to п¬Ѓnd a canonical basis but nondegeneracy of the symplectic form is very easy in our case thenonlinearity is unimportant in these problems probably no one consideredthe discrete variational problems in classical mathematics this business wasused in the theory of solitons for the discrete linear second order systems inthe theory of toda lattice and discrete kdv since the works  it was started for the second order nonlinear systems in  for the discrete systems of higher order we do not know any literature our main idea isthat for the graphs and simplicial complexes instead of line as a time we havea symplectic form taking values in the linear space of the open onecyclesz openk  cconsider now any graph Оі which is presented as a regular zcoveringover the п¬Ѓnite graph Оі with free simplicial action of the monodromy groupz generated by the map f p  Оі  Оі f  Оі  Оі f p  p ftheorem  any operator of the п¬Ѓnite order in the graph Оі with free zaction and п¬Ѓnite factor can be presented as a higher order vectorvalued operator on the discretized linelattice z the operators with zinvariant coefп¬Ѓcients ie operators whose coeп¬ѓcients are coming from the graph Оі willbe presented as operators with constant coeп¬ѓcients on the discretized linewe call this presentation a direct image of the operator on the latticezproof for the proof we construct a map f  Оі  r commuting wthfree zaction it certainly exists first of all we choose initial vertices inonetoone correspondence with vertices of the factorspace Оі it is good tochoose them in the fundamental domain of the minimal size for the groupz in Оі starting from any initial vertex we map all these initial verticesinto   z after that we map all other vertices following the group actionthe continuation to the skeleton of Оі is easy for any edge its boundaryvertices already mapped into r the linear continuation is unique it mighthappen that image of the edge is an interval n n + k where k   thereforethe original edge should be subdivided in k parts after that we have asimplicial zinvariant map any function on the vertices of the graph Оі canbe naturally and tautologically presented as a vectorvalued function П€n onthe vertices of the discretized line z with the number of components of vectorП€n numerated by the vertices from f n  Оі after this presentation ofthe functional space we can see that the same operator looks as an operatorof п¬Ѓnite order on the lattice z theorem is provedscattering and symplectic geometryas it was pointed out in paragraph  any combinatorial schrodingeroperator l of the order k acting on the functions on the set of simplices ofany dimension can be considered as an operator l of the order k

poles of the s scattering matrix in turnthese states can be deп¬Ѓned as solutions of the timeindependent schrodingerequation with purely outgoing waves at large distances  several attemptshave been performed to handle adequately resonant states the main obstaclebeing the divergent behaviour of the corresponding wave functions at largedistances which makes it impossible to normalize them in an inп¬Ѓnite volumewith the conventional mathematical tools the п¬Ѓrst succesful attempt tohandle resonant wave functions has been made by tore bergreen  usinga regularization method п¬Ѓrst suggested by

rhs of entire hardyclass functions deп¬Ѓned in a halfcomplex energyplane this allows to extend analyticaly the concept of aresonant state as an antilinear complex functional over the intersection ofschwartz test functions with hardy classa more general theory of resonant states follows if the rhs is built upon tempered ultradistributions in this case resonant states arise ascontinuous linear functionals over rapidly decreasing entire analytical testfunctions this can be obtained by using the diracs formula which allowsa more direct determination of these states another advantage of usingtempered ultradistributions is that only the physical spectrum appears inthe deп¬Ѓnition of complexenergy states in the present paper we want to show that it is possible to deп¬Ѓne a complexpseudonorm for resonant states in the sense of bergreen using temperedultradistributions with this pseudonorm we generalize the bergreens result and hence it can be considered as the proper

whether the charges are conserved or not see chapter  section  if they are conserved then thelagrangian describing the system shares the symmetry of the backgroundin the sense that the action of the symmetry group leaves the lagrangianinvariant it is for this reason that large classes of dynamical systems haveisomorphic algebras of overall noether chargesit need not be true however that the algebra of conserved charges coincides with the algebra of noether charges if a lagrangian transforms underthe group only semiinvariantly this being a term that will be explained inchapter  the conserved charges extend the noether charge algebra by topological central or noncentral charges these charges measure the nontrivialhomology of the background spacetime as well as nontrivial topological conп¬Ѓgurations of gauge п¬Ѓelds in the lagrangian now on every conп¬Ѓguration ofthe system ie on every solution of the underlying dynamical equations eachcharge takes on a certain real or grassmannvalue this speciп¬Ѓc ntupel ofvalues in turn distinguishes a class of conп¬Ѓgurations of the underlying theorynamely those for which the collection of conserved charges produces the samentupel of real or grassmannvalues if the algebra of charges determines onexponentiation a superlie group g say then we will refer to these distinguished classes of conп¬Ѓgurations as gstates see section  in chapter or simply states we can now state that the major topic of this thesis isthe interplay of states that transform under a given superlie group andthe geometry and topology of the background in which the physical systemis evolving in chapter  we will see that an important tool in handling theseproblems in a classical context will be a mapping of phase spaces of diп¬Ђerenttopologies which nevertheless look locally the same technically speakingwe shall relate the dynamics on a topologically nontrivial phase space to thedynamics on a covering phase space by preserving the local structure of thedynamics involved ultimately in order to gain a better understanding of themultiplets of states on the topologically nontrivial phase spaceaspects of these ideas are worked out in chapters  the line of reasoning connecting the diп¬Ђerent chapters is as followsin chapter  we study classical solutions of d   type ii supergravitydescribing extended objects commonly called dpbranes pbranes are solitons carrying conserved charges that act as sources for antisymmetric gaugeп¬Ѓelds in the underlying supergravity theory dpbranes arise from mixedboundary conditions on open strings in type ii string theory they are introduced as p + dimensional hypersurfaces in a spacetime where openstrings are constrained to end on a spacelike section of a dbrane can acquire a п¬Ѓnite volume in a spacetime with compact dimensions by wrappingaround nontrivial homology cycles of the spacetime in this case the supertranslation algebra of conserved charges carried by the dbrane is extendedby topological charges in chapter  we perform a naive analysis of thesetopological extensions of the modiп¬Ѓed noether charge algebras carried by dbranes this analysis is called naive as in the п¬Ѓrst place we are assumingthat the brane is propagating in a п¬‚at dimensional superminkowski spacewhose superisometry group is maximal and coincides with the n   superpoincare group in ten dimensions this superminkowski space is known tobe a solution of massless type iia supergravity in ten dimensions propagation of the brane in this п¬Ѓxed background is described by a lagrangianwhich is semiinvariant under the supertranslation group this means thatapart from a supersymmetric kinetic term the lagrangian contains a termlw z which arises from the pullback of a p + form ОІ on the target spacewhose diп¬Ђerential dОІ is a nontrivial cocycle in the chevalleyeilenberg cohomology on the supertranslation group consequently the form ОІ whichis usually called a wesszumino form is not leftinvariant physically thewesszumino term in the lagrangian describes the coupling of the extendedobject to the various antisymmetric tensor п¬Ѓelds in the underlying supergravity the fact that ОІ is not leftinvariant gives rise to the algebra extensionsencountered in the sequel this follows since subjecting lw z to supertranslations produces de rham cocycles on the worldvolume of the brane whichcan be nontrivial ie closed but not exact provided that both the worldvolume and the background space time have nontrivial homology and thebrane is wrapping around such homology cycles these de rham cocyclesmake themselves apparent by central charges in the modiп¬Ѓed noether chargealgebra which extend the supertranslation algebra on the superspacetimetechnically these central charges arise as integrals of the nontrivial de rhamcocycles over nontrivial homology cycles in the worldvolume of the extendedobject further extensions can arise from gauge п¬Ѓelds on the worldvolumeof the brane that are forced to transform under the supersymmetry groupon the superminkowski space in order to keep the kinetic term in the lagrangian of the brane supertranslationinvariant the analysis in chapter shows how these extensions appear in principal by the mechanism just described in actuality the central charges that describe nontrivial homologyof the target space all vanish in this case since a п¬‚at superminkowski spaceis topologically trivial and has no nontrivial homology cycles the extensions that are solely due to the gauge п¬Ѓeld might still be nonzero howeverput it another way assuming that some of the central charges pertaining tospacetime homology that appear in the extension  are indeed nonzeroimplies that the actual target space cannot be a п¬‚at superminkowski spacebut rather must be a compactiп¬Ѓed and possibly nonп¬‚at supergravity solution in this case the isometry group of the actual target space will beonly a proper subgroup of the maximal supertranslation group in ten п¬‚atspacetime dimensions therefore the analysis of this chapter gives only ageneral pattern which has to be reп¬Ѓned once a compactiп¬Ѓed version of thetendimensional target space has been chosen which is why we have calledthis approach naivethese considerations naturally lead us to the question how a compactiп¬Ѓedspacetime can arise as a solution of an underlying supergravity in particularis it possible to obtain a compactiп¬Ѓed spacetime from a noncompactiп¬Ѓed onewithout violating the property of being a solution to some underlying п¬Ѓeldtheory say a supergravity here a crucial point is that the supergravity п¬Ѓeldequations are purely local this means that once we have found a solutionto these equations constructing identiп¬Ѓcation spaces typically orbit spacesof the noncompactiп¬Ѓed solution under the free properly discontinuous action of a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the noncompactiп¬Ѓedversion must yield another solution to the underlying supergravity simplybecause identifying points of the spacetime under such a group action preserves all local properties of the spacetime changing only the global topology if the noncompactiп¬Ѓed solution was a manifold and not itself a morecomplicated topological space then the compactiп¬Ѓed orbit space is again amanifold more generally the noncompactiп¬Ѓed version is a covering space ofthe compactiп¬Ѓed one it is important to understand in which sense this construction changes the global topology of the spacetime the main statementhere is that the fundamental group and hence the п¬Ѓrst homology groupbecomes larger in the process of identiп¬Ѓcation the fundamental group of thenoncompactiп¬Ѓed spacetime becomes a normal subgroup of the fundamental group of the compactiп¬Ѓed version and the quotient of the compactiп¬Ѓedfundamental group over this normal factor basically gives the discrete groupwhose orbits deп¬Ѓne the compactiп¬Ѓcation another important classical result is that the higher homotopy groups of the spacetime are left invariantin this process however higher homology groups can become nontrivialas well as an example think of an rdimensional torus factor in a compactiп¬Ѓed spacetime which gives rise to a nontrivial homology group hralthough toroidal compactiп¬Ѓcations of a п¬‚at noncompactiп¬Ѓed spacetime areconceptually very simple they are nevertheless of central importance sincean important result by  states that in the п¬‚at case it is precisely the classof toroidally compactiп¬Ѓed spacetimes that are geodesically complete homogeneous spaces in this case the discrete group acting on the noncompactiп¬Ѓedп¬‚at version is a group of pure translations this result is a special case of amore general beautiful structure theorem about п¬‚at connected homogeneousgeodesically complete pseudoriemannian manifolds proven on p  in if a compactiп¬Ѓed spacetime arises as an orbit space from an ndimensionalcovering spacetime as discussed above it is comparatively easy to obtainthe precise form of the bosonic part of the super isometry group of thecompactiп¬Ѓed version from the larger isometry group of the covering space inparticular this means that global aspects of the residual isometry group canbe computed it it for this reason that we have mainly worked with riemannп¬‚at spacetimes in chapters  and  in chapter  we made no assumptionsabout curvature properties of the underlying manifolds however so that theresults derived in this chapter hold in full generalityit is a wellknown result that if Оі denotes a discrete subgroup of thelarger isometry group which acts on a covering spacetime then the isometry group of the orbit space ie the compactiп¬Ѓed version is given by thequotient n Оі Оі where n Оі denotes the normalizer of the group Оі inthe larger isometry group for an explanation of the term normalizer seechapter  the bosonic part of the isometry group of the compactiп¬Ѓedspacetime in this construction typically has the structure of a product of alowerdimensional superpoincare or galileigroup with a discrete or liegroup which describes internal symmetries in particular this is true if thegroup Оі is a discrete group of translations acting on a п¬‚at minkowskitypecovering spacein this case the resulting compactiп¬Ѓcation is a cartesianproduct of a п¬‚at n  mdimensional space with an internal mdimensionaltorus  this approach via the normalizer does not explain the reduction ofthe number of supersymmetry generators however a precise investigationof this point must involve global computations of killing spinors equationsand has to examine whether the bosonic part of the supermanifold admitsa spin structure these considerations are outside the scope of this workhoweverin a toruscompactiп¬Ѓcation of a riemannп¬‚at spacetime one can distinguish two major cases according to whether all basic lattice vectors of thegroup Оі are spacelike or whether one of these lattice vectors is lightliketimelike lattice vectors are not considered in this work as they give rise toa compact time direction see for example  and the references thereinit is fairly wellknown that if all m basis vectors are spacelike the externalspacetime is an n  m dimensional super minkowski spacetime and therestriction of the metric to the internal torus is euclidean furthermore theassociated isometry group is a direct product of a lowerdimensional n  mdimensional external super poincare group and a semidirect product ofa discrete rotation group with a product u m this last factor describingthe translational symmetries of the internal torus in chapter  we have performed an analogous investigation for the case that one lattice vector in thegroup Оі is lightlike with the purpose to understand the precise structureof the resulting isometries including possible discrete transformations theanalysis reveals the somewhat unexpected result that the resulting isometrygroup admits a natural extension to a semigroup the semigroup transformations form a discrete set isomorphic to the positive natural numbers withmultiplication as composition and arise from the fact that the metric of thecovering spacetime when restricted to the subspace spanned by the latticevectors generating Оі is degenerate in this case the compactiп¬Ѓed spacetimeis again a cartesian product of some rnm times an internal torus but therestriction of the metric to both the external and the internal factor is nowdegenerate the lie algebra of the isometry group of the compactiп¬Ѓed spacetime turns out to be the direct sum of an abelian lie algebra isomorphic torm and a centrally extended galilei algebra in n  m   dimensionsthe semigroup transformations correspond to discrete transformations generated by the mass generator which spans the central extension of theextended galilei group as the mass generator commutes with all othergenerators of the lie algebra its quantum version should provide a superselection operator for the spacetime degrees of freedom of the theory thismeans that the discrete winding numbers of the lightlike torus around itself should label noncoherent ie nonsuperposable subspaces of physicalstates in the overall hilbert space of a system deп¬Ѓned on this compactiп¬Ѓedspacetimethe motivation for the developments in chapter  lies again in the resultsof chapter  on topological extensions of noether charge algebras we maynaturally pose the question on which kind of space such an extended algebrais represented or realized in a quantum context the answer would normallybe straightforward we would assume that the overall hilbert space of statesof the theory containes physical subspaces each of which is labelled by thecollection of conserved values of the topological generators this wouldbe even more natural as the topological charges typically take on discretevalues according to the fact that they represent winding numbers degrees ofmaps or are associated with chern classes of gauge п¬Ѓelds as in formula of chapter  but what would be the analogous classical construction beforewe can think about this problem we must understand what we mean by sayingthat a physical state transforms under a symmetry group g again in thequantum context the answer is comparatively simple a state transformingunder a group g or a gstate is an element of a subvector space of an overallhilbert space which serves as a carrier space for an irreducible representationof g if eib is an irreducible representation of g on this carrier space andП€i is a state vector in this subspace then the mean value of the observablea being an element of the lie algebra of g on the transformed state eib П€iishaieibП€icidadcideibcid acidП€ithe last two statements can be transferred into the classical domain as follows irreducibility means that the group acts transitively on a certain subspace of states we learned this from  but transitivity of a group actionis a meaningful concept in the classical context as well also formula has a classical counterpart given by the ad gtransformation behaviourof global moment maps associated with the action of g as deп¬Ѓned in section  of chapter  with the help of a global moment map one canpartition the underlying phase space into subsets such that the dynamics ofevery physical system that is ginvariant which means that the hamiltonian poissoncommutes with all phase space functions representing the liealgebra of the group g lies completely in one of these subsets this followssince the moment map is constant on each of these subsets and hence allgenerators of g are conserved on trajectories that lie entirely in one of thesesubsets these subsets coincide with the gstates described in the secondparagraph of this introduction now the following problem arises on aphase space or more general on a symplectic manifold a global momentmap associated with a symplectic group action is available only if the phasespace is simply connected but this is not true in general for the phase spaceswe are concerned in this work as these spaces will have nontrivial topologyin general however symplectic group actions can be deп¬Ѓned on nonsimplyconnected phase spaces as well and clearly the concept of conserved chargesmakes sense also on a phase space with nontrivial topology in chapter  wetherefore take up the problem of how one can deп¬Ѓne gstates as deп¬Ѓned bymoment maps on such a space the nonsimply connectedness is an obstruction to the existence of global moment maps we will show however howone can remove this obstruction be transferring the dynamics to a universalsymplectic covering manifold on which a global moment map exists thisconstruction is based on the fact that a covering projection is a local diffeomorphism which can be regarded as a local symplectomorphism betweensimply connected and nonsimply connected phase spaces in turn one candeп¬Ѓne gstates on the compactiп¬Ѓed phase space via the notion of gstateson the covering space at the end of chapter  it is shown then that thegstates on the compactiп¬Ѓed phase space and its covering space are relatedby an identiп¬Ѓcation map where states on the covering space are identiп¬Ѓedunder the action of the deck transformation group of the covering thisworks out successfully some aspects of the idea that was alluded to at thebeginning of this introduction which proposed that the multiplet structureof states living on a topologically nontrivial phase space can be related tomultiplets on a phase space whose topological structure is simpler namelysuch a simplifying construction is available whenever the nontrivial homology of a phase space can be traced back to the fact that the phase space isan orbit space of a topologically simpler symplectic covering manifoldchapter topological extensions of thealgebra of noether chargesintroductiontopological extensions of the algebra of noether currents and corresponding noether charges have been studied in the past by a number of authors  in  the extensions of the algebra of noether and modiп¬Ѓed noethercharges carried by supersymmetric extended objects have been examinedfurthermore it has been pointed out that the origin of these modiп¬Ѓcationsis the wesszumino term in the lagrangian of the extended object in the algebra of the noether supercharges of the mbrane was derived andit was observed that not all central charges occuring in the superalgebra extension are entirely due to the wesszumino term it was shown that anothercontribution to the central charges originates in the presence of a gauge п¬Ѓeldpotential on the worldvolume of the mbrane which takes part in the action of the superpoincare group acting on the target space in this chapterwe shall prove a theorem explaining that this is a general feature for a wholeclass of lagrangians containing a gauge potential on the worldvolume whichis forced to transform under a lie group that acts on the target space of thetheory in this case even the algebra of the unmodiп¬Ѓed noether chargessuп¬Ђers modiп¬Ѓcations which otherwise would close into the original algebraof the group that acts on the target space possibly up to a sign which is aconsequence of whether the group acts from the left or from the rightin this chapter we have performed an analysis of the extensions of thesuperalgebra of noether and modiп¬Ѓed noether charges carried by dpbranesin a iia superspace in doing so however we have faced a number of diп¬ѓculties which could not be illuminated by consulting the literature in section we therefore provide an introduction to the basic concepts of the algebra of noether currents noether charges and associated modiп¬Ѓed currentsand charges which might arise from a lagrangian transforming as a semiinvariant under the action of the group we show that for a left actionthe algebra of the associated noether charges always closes to the originalalgebra regardless of whether the lagrangian is invariant under the transformation or not we derive the action of the noether charges on the currentsand show that for a left action the noether currents transfom in the adjoint representation of the group we then extend this analysis to the case ofsemiinvariant lagrangians and examine carefully under which circumstancescertain contributions to the poisson brackets of the modiп¬Ѓed currents vanish or may be neglected this question is not always fully adressed in theliterature and becomes even more nontrivial in the case of having a gaugeп¬Ѓeld present on the worldvolume since the gauge п¬Ѓeld degrees of freedomare subject to primary and secondary constraints in diracs terminologywe analyze the constraint structure of a theory possessing such a gauge п¬Ѓeldon the worldvolume the results apply to dbranes and mbranes as wellwe derive conditions under which the additional charges obtained so far areconserved and central we п¬Ѓnish the п¬Ѓrst section with showing how modiп¬Ѓcations of the noether charge algebra arise from the presence of such a gaugeп¬Ѓeld even if the modiп¬Ѓcations of the charge algebra due to semiinvariantpieces in the lagrangian are not yet taken into accountin section  we apply these ideas to derive the extensions of the algebraof modiп¬Ѓed noether charges for dpbrane lagrangians in iia superspacewe п¬Ѓrst derive a general form of these extensions applicable for the mostgeneral forms of gauge п¬Ѓelds nsns and rr on the superspace then wechoose a particular background in putting all bosonic components of thegauge п¬Ѓelds to zero and taking into account that the remainder are subjectto superspace constraints which allow to reconstruct the leading componentsof the rr gauge п¬Ѓeld strengths unambiguously in doing so we must checkwhether the rr п¬Ѓeld strengths thus derived actually satisfy the appropriatebianchi identities we п¬Ѓnd that this question can be traced back to the validityof a set of generalized Оіmatrix identitiesit is known that the п¬Ѓrst twomembers in this set are actually valid as for the rest we derive a necessarycondition using the technique that has been applied in similar circumstancespreviously see   and п¬Ѓnd that it is satisп¬Ѓed the extended algebra thusderived contains topological charges that probe the existence of compactspacetime dimensions the brane is wrapping around furthermore which is anew feature here we п¬Ѓnd that central charges show up that probe the nontriviality of the worldvolume regarded as a u bundle of the gauge п¬ЃeldaВµ we п¬Ѓnd that for the d  and branes there exist central chargesoriginating in the wesszumino term that can be interpreted as probing thecoupling of these nontrivial gaugeп¬Ѓeld conп¬Ѓgurations to compact dimensionsin the spacetime they are zero if either there are no compact dimensions orthe brane is not wrapping around them or the u bundle is trivial whichrequires the gauge п¬Ѓeld conп¬Ѓguration to be trivial as for the dbranesuch a coupling of spacetime topology to the gauge п¬Ѓeld is only present inthe central charges that stem from the fact that the gauge п¬Ѓeld transformsunder supersymmetry they have nothing to do with the wesszumino termfor the special case of a dbrane given by r  s where r denotes thetime dimension we п¬Ѓnd that the algebra can contain the charge of a diracmonopole of the gauge п¬Ѓeld this result is very neat so we present it hereqО± qОІ   cОіmО±ОІ  pm  i cОіОіmО±ОІ  y m  i cОіmmО±ОІ  t mm  i cОіО±ОІ  ПЂghere y m is a central charge that couples the canonical gauge

becomeequations the consistency of which has to be examined separatelyif theconstraints are properly chosen the equations so obtained are just the supergravity equations of motiondbranes arise from

nontrivial cycles in the spacetime in this case the supertranslation algebra of noethercharges or modiп¬Ѓed charges carried by the brane is extended by topologicalcharges which we derive belowwe want to consider dbranes in a п¬‚at iia background this conditionrequires the underlying supergravity theory to be massless m   since itis known that d   minkowski spacetime is not a solution to the п¬Ѓeldequations of massive iia supergravity  the massless theory allows a п¬‚atsolution however its constraints ie the constraints on the massless iiasupergravity background can be obtained by dimensional reduction of thestandard d   superspace constraints  in particular they imply theп¬Ѓeld equations of massless iia supergravity moreover we have the observation that once the constraints on the nsns п¬Ѓelds coupling to the kineticsupersymmetry invariant term in the dbrane action are given the constraints on the rrп¬Ѓelds coupling to the brane via the wesszumino termcan be read oп¬Ђ from

isometry group ent of a п¬‚at pseudoeuclidean space rnt  that preserve the points of a lattice lat whose associatedreal vector space lat called the rlinear enveloppe of the lattice is lightlike in this case the restriction of the metric О· with signature t +s tolat is no longer deп¬Ѓnite this gives rise to the possibility of having latticepreserving transformations in the overall pseudoeuclidean group ent thatare injective but no longer surjective on the lattice in other words theirinverses do not preserve lat the set of all these transformations thereforewill no longer be a group but only a semigroup since it is precisely thelattice preserving transformations that descend to the quotient of rnt overthe discrete group of primitive lattice translations Оі ie to the compactit Оі  rnm  t m these semigroup elements constitute anп¬Ѓed spacetime rnextension of the isometry group i rnt Оі which act noninvertibly on thecompactiп¬Ѓed space we present in detail the case of the compactiп¬Ѓcation ofa lorentzian spacetime over a lightlike lattice Оі where it is shown that thenoninvertible elements wind the lightlike circle k times around itself we argue that this should map the diп¬Ђerent sectors of a lagrange theory on rnt Оіas labelled by the lightlike compactiп¬Ѓcation radius in a oneway process intoeach other in the case under consideration this map will be accomplishedby п¬Ѓnite discrete transformations generated by the mass generator of thecentrally extended galilei group since it is known that the eigenvalues ofthis generator label diп¬Ђerent superselection sectors of a theory we arguethat our semigroup transformations connect diп¬Ђerent superselection sectorsof any lagrange theory on a lightlike compactiп¬Ѓed spacetimethe plan of this chapter is as follows in section  we provide some background on orbit spaces and the associated п¬Ѓbre preserving sets in section we introduce our notation conventions in section  and  we introduce our concepts of lattice preserving transformations and examine someof their structure in particular we show in a theorem why no semigroupextensions are available in a euclidean background space or more generallyfor a lattice whose rlinear enveloppe lat is spacelike in section  we construct the sets normalizing a lightlike lattice in a minkowski spacetime insection  we show how the semigroup transformations act on the lightlikecircle of the spacetime and how they relate theories belonging to diп¬Ђerentcompactiп¬Ѓcation radii orbit spaces and normalizing setsassume that a group g has a left action on a topological space x suchthat the map g  x  g x  gx is a homeomorphism when a discretesubgroup Оі  g acts properly discontinuously and freely on x then thenatural projection p  x  xОі of x onto the space of orbits xОі canbe made into a covering map and x becomes a covering space of xОі eg    more specially if x  m is a connected pseudoriemannianmanifold with a metric О· and g  i m is the group of isometries of mso that Оі is a discrete subgroup of isometries acting on m then there is aunique way to make the quotient mОі a pseudoriemannian manifold eg  in this construction one stipulates that the projection p be a localisometry which determines the metric on mОі in such a case we speak ofp  m  mОі as a pseudoriemannian coveringin both cases the quotient p  x  xОі can be regarded as a principalп¬Ѓbre bundle with bundle space x base xОі and Оі as structure group theп¬Ѓbre over m  xОі being the orbit of any element x  p m under Оіie p m  Оіx  Оіx  Оі  Оі if g  g induces the homeomorphismx  gx of x or an isometry of m then g gives rise to a welldeп¬Ѓned mapg  xОі  xОі only when g preserves all п¬Ѓbres ie when g Оіx  Оі gxfor all x  x this is equivalent to saying that gОіg  Оі if this relationis replaced by the stronger condition gОіg  Оі then g is an element of thenormalizer n Оі of Оі in g wheren Оі cidg  g  gОіg  Оіcid the normalizer is a group by construction it contains all п¬Ѓbre preservingelements g of g such that g is п¬Ѓbre preserving as well in particular itcontains the group Оі which acts trivially on the quotient space this meansthat for any Оі  Оі the induced map Оі  xОі  xОі is the identity onxОі Оі  idxОі this follows since the action of Оі on the orbit Оіx sayis deп¬Ѓned to be Оі Оіx  Оі Оіx  Оіx where the last equality holds sinceОі is a groupin this work we are interested in relaxing the equality in the conditiondeп¬Ѓning n Оі to this end we introduce what we call the extended normalizerdenoted by en Оі throughen Оі cidg  g  gОіg  Оіcid the elements g  g which give rise to welldeп¬Ѓned maps g on xОі aretherefore precisely the elements of the extended normalizer en Оі as wehave seen in the discussion above such elements g are said to descend tothe quotient space xg hence en Оі contains all homeomorphisms of xisometries of m that descend to the quotient space xОі mОі the normalizer n Оі on the other hand contains all those g for which g descendsto the quotient as well thus n Оі is the group of all g which descend toinvertible maps g homeomorphisms isometries on the quotient spacein the case of a semiriemannian manifold m for which the group g is theisometry group i m the normalizer n Оі therefore contains all isometriesof the quotient space the only point being that the action of n Оі is noteп¬Ђective since Оі  n Оі acts trivially on mОі however Оі is a normalsubgroup of n Оі so that the quotient n Оі Оі is a group again which isnow seen to act eп¬Ђectively on mОі and the isometries of mОі which descendfrom isometries of m are in a  relation to elements of this group thusdenoting the isometry group of the quotient space mОі as i mОі we havethe wellknown result thati mОі  n Оі Оі Оі take an arbitrary x  m then g Оіx now we turn to the extended normalizer for a general element g en Оі the induced map g is no longer injective on xОі to see this assumethat for a п¬Ѓxed element g  g the inclusion in deп¬Ѓnition  is proper iegОіg Оі gx this means thatthere exists an element z  Оі gx that is not the image under g of any Оіx inthe orbit Оіx hence since g is invertible on x there exists an x  x whoseorbit Оіx is diп¬Ђerent from the orbit Оіx such that z  gx since g preservesп¬Ѓbres we have g Оіx Оі gx  Оіz  Оі gx the last equality followingsince z lies in the orbit of gx this implies that the induced map g mapsthe distinct orbits Оіx  Оіx into the same orbit Оі gx which expresses thatg is not injective in particular if g was an isometry of m then g canno longer be an isometry on the quotient space since it is not invertible italso follows that en Оі will not be a group in general for this reason theelements of the extended normalizer seem to have attracted limited attentionin the literature so farin this work however we will show that the extended normalizer naturally emerges when we study identiп¬Ѓcation spaces mОі where m  rn О·is п¬‚at rn endowed with a symmetric bilinear form О· with signature t +sor index t to such a space m we will also refer to as m  rnt  the group Оіwill be realized as a discrete group of translations in m the elements beingin  correspondence with the points of a lattice lat  rnt  which is regardedas a subset of rnt  we will п¬Ѓnd that in the lorentzian case the fact thatthe identity component so+n  on is no longer compact will give riseto a natural extension of the isometry group n Оі Оі of the quotient mОіto the set en Оі Оі provided that the rlinear enveloppe of the lattice isa lightlike subvector space we do not consider lattices whose associatedrlinear vector space is timelike this would give rise to compactiп¬Ѓcationsalong a time direction we will show that en Оі Оі in general has thestructure of a semigroup naturally

symmetries these notions will be appropriate to examinethe peculiarities that arise when the vector space rnis noneuclidean ontthe one hand they extend the usual terminology encountered in crystallography on the other hand our deп¬Ѓnition of a lattice is adapted to thepurposes of this paper and therefore somewhat simpliп¬Ѓed compared withthe most general deп¬Ѓnitions possible in crystallography this means that afull adaption of our terminology introduced here with wellestablished crystallographic notions would have been a tedious task with no contribution todeeper understanding we therefore have made no attempt to do soin this work we restrict attention to lattices that contain the origin   rnas a lattice point which suп¬ѓces for our purposes let   m  n letutthe subset tlat  entelements of latis the subgroup of all translations in ent throughtlat  tz   ent  tz  latelements of tlat are called primitive translationsnow we introduce the set pres lat which is deп¬Ѓned to be the set of alldiп¬Ђeomorphisms on rnt preserving lat iepres lat  П†  dif f rnt   П† lat  latevery such П† is invertible hence surjective on rnt  however it need not besurjective on lat which means that inverses in this set do not necessarily exist neither is it required that П† be linear pres lat is therefore a semigroupwith composition of maps as multiplication and idrnas unit elementtwe also deп¬Ѓne the associated setpres lat  П†  dif f rnt   П† lat  lat  pres latpres lat contains all diп¬Ђeomorphisms of pres lat whose restriction to latis invertible and hence is a groupthe intersectionsym  pres lat  entwe term the set of symmetries of the lattice lat andsym  pres lat  entwe call the set of invertible symmetries of lat sym is a group by construction on the other hand sym is only a semigroup since inverses in sym all translations in tlat belong to sym there are no pure translations in sym other than primitive translations from tlat tlat is normal in symproof the п¬Ѓst two statements are obvious as for the third assume t  sym were no element of tlat then it would map the lattice point  intothe lattice point t which is a contradition now prove  since by translations tz  belong to sym we have that for a given t r  symthe product t r tz  t r  sym as well but this product equalsrtz  hence is a pure translation hence by  must belong to tlat whichproves tlat  symcidthese results do not a priori imply however that p sym  tlat weshow below that this is true for symwe now examine the projection of sym onto the second factor p syma priori it is not clear whether this projection is a subset of sym sym ornot we will see shortly that indeed p sym  sym we start withobserving that the elements  r of p sym are in  correspondencewith the left cosets tlat  t r where t r is in the inverse image p rthis follows since tlat is a subgroup of sym so that tlatt r is certainly inthe inverse image and furthermore any two elements in this coset must diп¬Ђerby a primitive translation since for t r t r we have t r  symhence t r t r  t  t   sym it is at this point that we needthe condition that t r be in sym rather in sym the last equation saysthat t  t  must be a primitive translation since sym contains no othertranslations than these from these considerations we conclude that theremust exist a coset representative denoted by П„r r of the coset tlat  t rsuch thatthis deп¬Ѓnes a mapП„r mxiqi  ui  qi   П„ cidsym  wt r  tz + П„r r  П„rwhich is constant on the cosets we remark that if the map П„   is identically zero then the associated group sym is called symmorphic in crystallography see eg we now deп¬Ѓne the following subgroups of sym sym rot  О»  sym  О»   rrot  rot  sym ie these are the subsets of sym sym respectively that are pure pseudoeuclidean rotations we can now prove the result announced above propositionthe projection of sym onto the rotational factor coincides with the setof all pure rotations in sym iepcidsymcid  rot proof the inclusion    is trivial we prove     if  r  p sym thenthere exists a vector t  w not necessarily in lat so that  r  p t randas a corollary we infer the result we have announced after proposition namelypcidsymcid  tlatthus all elements of sym have a standard decomposition tz r  tz   r tlat  rot according to  furthermore the groups tlat and rot haveonly the unit element   in common and tlat is normal in sym thuswe have proven the propositionsym is the semidirect productsym  tlat  rot as an immediate conclusion we see that we must havetlat  rot  sym we have not examined however whether this inclusion is proper or if symcan contain elements t r for which t  latfinally we present a condition under which rot coincides with rot thissheds some light on the question under which circumstances sym is actuallya proper subset of sym theoremif ind lat   or ind lat  m ie minimal or maximal then rot  rotproof we п¬Ѓrst assume that ind w    ie О· w is positive deп¬Ѓnite letО»  rot since О» preserves lat it also preserves its rlinear enveloppe w ie О»w  w  let x y  w arbitrary then О»x О»y  w  this says that О· w   О» w  x  О» w  y  О· О»x О»y  О· x y   О· w  x ywhich says that the restriction О» w of О» to the subvector space w preservesthe bilinear form О· w on this space but О· w is positive deп¬Ѓnite by assumption hence О» w  o w  where o w  denotes the orthogonal groupof w now we assume that О» has the propertyО»  sym and О»  sym  lat this means that О» lat is not surjective hencein other words О»lat x  lat  О»u  x for all u  lat x cannot be zero since   lat

the following we examine in detail the extended normalizer ofa group Оі  tlat whose associated lattice lat is given as follows the basisvectors ueof g  rot u+r  on the set of all v   forms an abelian

the set of all  c clearly is a subgroup isomorphic to on since  a    c   c  a  the last two subgroups form a direct product subgroupr  on of g furthermore using the group law  again we seethat

covering spaces and momentmapsintroductionfor a physical system whose lagrangian is invariant under the action ofthe isometry group g of a background spacetime the algebra of conservedcharges coincides with the noether charge algebra of the system associatedwith the isometry groupin recent years it was observed by many authors working in the п¬Ѓeld of high energy physics that when classical orquantum п¬Ѓelds propagate in background spacetimes which are topologicallynontrivial then the associated algebra of conserved charges may reп¬‚ect thisnontriviality by exhibiting extensions of the noether charge algebra whichmeasure the topology of the background provided the system is only semiinvariant under the isometry group of the spacetime see eg  on theother hand the algebra of conserved charges deп¬Ѓnes a partition of the underlying phase space by distinguishing those subsets of the phase space onwhich the values of all conserved charges involved are constant this is justthe п¬Ѓrst step to a marsdenweinstein reduction these subsets then couldbe called elements of classical gmultiplets a multiplet being deп¬Ѓned asa gorbit of such subsets on every such multiplet the symmetry group gacts transitively thus exhibiting a property which is the classical analogue ofan irreducible representation in the quantum theory  now if dynamicalsystems are described in the framework of symplectic formalism the quantity determining this phase space partition is what we call a global momentmap on the phase space however this global moment map need not existin the case that the phase space is not simply connected this observationwas the starting point for the investigations in this work for systems withп¬Ѓnite degrees of freedom we generalize the concept of a global moment mapto multiply connected phase spaces and general symplectic manifolds weshow that the appropriate generalization involves a locally deп¬Ѓned multivalued moment map whose diп¬Ђerent branches are labelled by the fundamental group of the phase space furthermore it is shown how the diп¬Ђerentlocal branches can be smoothly glued together by a glueing condition whichis expressed by certain cech cocycles on the underlying symplectic manifoldthese constructions are intimately related with the existence of a universalsymplectic covering manifold of the original phase space on the coveringglobal moment maps deп¬Ѓning gmultiplets always exist at the end of thiswork we show how these multiplets on the covering space can be related togmultiplets on the original symplectic manifold by an identiп¬Ѓcation mapwhich derives from the covering projectionin order to formulate these ideas rigourosly we п¬Ѓrst had to examine thequestion of liftability of symplectic group actions on a symplectic manifoldto a covering space in the course of this we proved a series of theoremsinvestigating the existence and uniqueness of such lifts and to which extentthe lifted action preserves the group structure of the original symmetry groupgthe plan of this chapter is as followsin section  we collect basicstatements about covering spaces on which the rest of this work relies insection  and  we examine multivalued potential functions for closed butnot exact diп¬Ђerential forms on a multiply connected manifold these considerations will be needed later on when examining local moment maps insection  we collect notation conventions and basic facts about symplectic manifolds hamiltonian vector п¬Ѓelds and cotangent bundles in section we study how covering projections can be extended to local symplectomorphisms of coverings of cotangent bundles sections  and  examinethe conditions under which an action of a lie group g on a manifold can belifted to an action on a covering manifold and when such a lift preserves thegroup law of g section  examines the relation between group actions oncovering spaces and equivariance of the covering map in  we introduceour notation for symplectic gactions on a symplectic manifold section recapitulates the notion of global moment maps as they are usually deп¬Ѓnedwhile this concept is generalized to local moment maps in the subsequentsection  equivariance of global and local moment maps is discussed insection  section  discusses the relation of local moment maps tocovering spaces which are themselves multiply connected in  we introduce the concept of gstates while the subsequent section  shows how asplitting of gstates on multiply connected symplectic manifold arises basic facts about coveringsin this section we quote the main results on coverings and lifting theorems onwhich the rest of this work is built it is mainly based on     in thiswork we are interested in covering spaces that are manifolds consequentlysome of the deп¬Ѓnitions and quotations of theorems to follow are not presentedin their full generality as appropriate for general topological spaces butrather we give working deп¬Ѓnitions and formulations pertaining to manifoldsand the fact that these are special topological spaces locally homeomorphicto rn a covering of manifolds is a triple p x y  where p  x  y isa smooth surjective map of smooth

is a diп¬Ђeomorphism every open v  y forwhich this is true is called admissible with respect to p this means thatfor each y  y  the inverse image p y  x called the п¬Ѓbre over y isdiscrete since y is connected all п¬Ѓbres have the same cardinality p iscalled projection or covering map a diп¬Ђeomorphism П†  x  x such thatp  П†  p is called a deck transformation of the covering the set d of alldeck

needed to formulate the concept of local moment maps on nonsimplyconnected symplectic manifolds in section  diп¬Ђerential forms on x and yfirst consider a smooth qform П‰ on y  the pullback П‰  pП‰ is a qform onx and П‰ is invariant under the deck transformation group of the coveringfor let Оі  d then ОіП‰  p  Оі П‰  П‰ conversely let П‰ be a qform onx then locally П‰ can be pulled back to y to give a multivalued qformon y  since the covering map p is a local diп¬Ђeomorphism to see this letv be an admissible neighbourhood of a point y  y  such that the inverseimage p v  is a disjoint union of neighbourhoods ui in x on each uithe restriction p ui  ui  y is a diп¬Ђeomorphism so that we can pull back p ui П‰ on v  this gives a multivalued qform on v  eachП‰ uibranch being labelled by some

acts transitivelyon the п¬Ѓbres of the covering means that this relation must hold for all decktransformations Оі  das a consequence if a qform П‰ on x is invariant under d then there isa uniquely determined qform П‰ on y such that П‰  pП‰ for П‰ is deп¬Ѓnedby mapping any vector w  tyy to plocw  where ploc denotes the restriction of p to one of the connected components of the inverse image of

precise the notion of multivalued functionsthat serve as local potentials for closed forms on the nonsimply connectedmanifold y  we want to express the local potentials as they were deп¬Ѓned informula  and their mutual relations in terms of locally deп¬Ѓned quantities and glueing conditions without explicit reference to a speciп¬Ѓc coveringmanifold it is clear that we must make up for the information that is lost bydiscarding the covering space from consideration by some additional structure on the manifold y  it turns out that the necessary ingredients area countable simply connected pathconnected open cover v va  y  a  aof y  ie a collection of countably many open sets va  y whose uniongives y  and such that every loop in va is homotopic in y to a constantloop and all va are pathconnectedsince y is a manifold a cover of the type just described always existswe note that as every element va  v is simply connected in y  it isautomatically admissible with respect to the covering map p  x  y  forassume it were not admissible then the inverse image p va contained aconnected hence pathconnected component u on which the restriction ofin particular there are points x x  u

connected elements of cech cohomology and its relation to covering spaces are explained in the appendixchapters b c dwe now explain what this condition means let p  x  y be a universalcovering manifold of y with base points x  x and y  y such that y p x the deck transformation group d of such a covering is isomorphicto the fundamental group ПЂ y y the isomorphism being deп¬Ѓned as in thediscussion preceding theorem  if О» is any loop class in ПЂ y y let О»denote the unique lift of О» to x then there exists a unique deck transformationОі such that Оіx  О»  this deck transformation is the image of О» underthe abovementioned isomorphism the manifold y can be considered as theorbit space xd with the quotient topology we now identify d with thefundamental group ПЂ y y so that y can be regarded as the orbit spacexПЂ y y ПЂ acting via deck transformations Оі on x and p  x  xd y is a dcoveringnext we note that although a simply connected covering manifold xof y is uniquely deп¬Ѓned up to disomorphisms in general there are also dcoverings q  z  y  zd of y which are not connected this means thaty can be expressed as an orbit space of diп¬Ђerent not necessarily connectedmanifolds z with base point z under an action of d these manifoldscan be assembled into equivalence classes equivalence being expressed bydisomorphism see appendix chapter c and a universal covering manifoldx

elements of d locally label the diп¬Ђerent sheets ofthe covering in a trivialization secondly d is the set of homotopy classesof loops at y on the base manifold y  we now construct a homomorphismПЃ from d as the set of homotopic loops to d as the labelling space forthe sheets of the covering choose a homotopy class Оі where Оі is a loopat the base point y  y  the unit interval   can be divided

another simply connected covering wehave seen above that the associated cocycles are cohomologous hence theassociated dhomomorphisms diп¬Ђer by an inner automorphism but since ПЃis the identity this means that every homomorphism ПЃ  d  d must be aninner automorphism of dthe developments of the last paragraph together with the content oftheorems  and  are summarized in theorem multivalued

arbitrary element in hcida  dcenterin the sequel we apply the covering techniques discussed so far to coveringsof symplectic manifolds we п¬Ѓrst present our notational conventions notation and conventions for symplecticmanifoldssections  are based on    we recall that a symplectic form П‰ on a manifold m is a closed nondegenerate form on m in this case the pair m П‰ is called a symplecticmanifold by f m we denote the set of all smooth functions f  m  r on asymplectic manifold we can make f m into a real lie algebra using poissonbrackets by П‡ m we denote the set of all smooth vector п¬Ѓelds on m if g is a lie group we will frequently denote its lie algebra by Л†g andthe coalgebra ie the space dual to Л†g by g given an action П†  g  m  m of a lie group g on a manifoldm we will frequently denote the components of its tangent map П† by П† cid П†on the other hand the set П‡lh m of vector п¬Ѓelds v on m which satisfylv П‰   where lv denotes a lie derivative is called the set of locally hamiltonianvector п¬Ѓelds this means that on every simply connected open neighbourhood u  m the form v  П‰ is exact hence there exists a smooth functionf  f u such thatv  П‰ + df   on u as  holds in a neighbourhood of every point we refer to v as a locallyhamiltonian vector п¬Ѓeld the functions f  f u need not be globallydeп¬Ѓnedif m is simply connected then every locally hamiltonian vectorп¬Ѓeld is hamiltonian and П‡lh m  П‡h m this will not be true for themanifolds we are interested in in this work cotangent bundlesin this section we compile some standard facts about cotangent bundles weshall use throughout this paper this material is discussed in standard textbooks on symplectic geometry eg  mechanics eg  diп¬Ђerentialgeometry eg  and algebraic topology eg  on the cotangent bundle t m of a manifold m we have a projectionП„  t m  m and a natural symplectic form being given as the diп¬ЂerentialП‰  dОё of the canonical form   Оё on t m which is deп¬Ѓned as

deп¬Ѓnition  it follows immediately that every f preserves thecanonical form Оёf  Оё  Оё coverings of cotangent bundlesin this section we start with symplectic manifolds t y dОё which are thecotangent bundles t y of nonsimply connected conп¬Ѓguration spaces y  andare endowed with the natural symplectic form dОё which is associated withthe canonical form Оё on the cotangent bundle then we extend a simplyconnected covering manifold x of y to a covering manifold t x of t y andshow how the projection map p  x  y can be extended to give a localsymplectomorphism between t x and t y which is also a covering map covering spaces and their cotangent bundleslet p  x  y be a covering of manifolds let Оё Оё denote the canonicalforms on the cotangent bundles t x t y  respectively see section the bundle projections are written as Пѓ  t x  x and П„  t y  y  thecanonical symplectic forms on t x t y are П‰  dОё П‰  dОё respectivelycentral to our developments is the observation that we can extend theprojection p to a covering map of cotangent bundles for all coverings it isunderstood that they are smooth theoremlet p  x  y be a covering then p can be extended to a bundle mapp  t x  t y such that p  t x  t y is a coveringproof we п¬Ѓrst have to show that a welldeп¬Ѓned extension p exists to this endlet v  y be an admissible open neighbourhood in y  and let u  x denotea connected component of p v  on every u the restriction p u  u  yis a diп¬Ђeomorphism hence its extension  p u cid p u  p ucidis welldeп¬Ѓned the collection of all u being the collection of all inverseimages of admissible open neighbourhoods v in y forms an open cover ofx on the intersection of any two of the u u the locally deп¬Ѓned maps coincide now deп¬Ѓne p to be the uniquely determined function ont x whose restriction to any of the u coincides with   p ufrom this it follows that p is welldeп¬Ѓned and is smooth provided p issmooth its local form  shows that p preserves п¬Ѓbres and hence is at y y is aneighbourhood in t y whose inverse image under p is a disjoint union ofneighbourhoods in t x this says that p is a covering mapcidbundle map if v is any admissible neighbourhood in y  then syvas a consequence of the last theorem we can pull back qforms П‰ ont y to qforms p П‰ on t x via p hence the pullback p Оё is welldeп¬Ѓned the next theorem explains the relation between this pullback andthe canonical symplectic potential Оё on t x to this end we note that lemmaП„  p  p  Пѓ proof t xthis follows from the deп¬Ѓnition p x О± cidp x   p u О±cid for x О± cid theoremthe pullback of the

associated dynamical system on the symplectic covering manifoldt x this is one of the major statements of this work as was shown in the homotopy groups of a cotangent bundle are isomorphic to thoseof its base space in particular if x is simply connected the fundamentalgroups obey the relationsПЂ t x  ПЂ x   ПЂ t y   ПЂ y   d and it follows that the deck transformation group d t x of the coveringp  t x  t y is just ПЂ t y   d this will enable us to removethe multivaluedness of a local moment map given on a cotangent spacet y by constructing the local symplectomorphism p and then studyingthe associated dynamics on the simply connected symplectic covering spacet x on which every locally hamiltonian vector п¬Ѓeld has a globally deп¬Ѓnedcharge and hence every symplectic group action has a global moment mapsee section  for the details our next task therefore is to study how liegroup actions deп¬Ѓned on y and in turn t y  can be lifted to a coveringspace space x and t x in particular when x is simply connected this isdone in sections  and  for general symplectic manifolds which are notnecessarily cotangent bundles lift of group actions under covering mapsin this section we prove a couple of theorems about the lifting of a left actionП† of a lie group g on a manifold y to a covering manifold x here weexamine existence and uniqueness of lifts in the next section we examineunder which conditions the group law of g is preserved under the liftlet p  x  y be a covering where x y are connected let v be amanifold let f  v  y  as explained in section  one calls a mapf  v  x a lift of f through p if p  f  f  for the sake of conveniencewe establish a similar phrase for a related construction which will frequentlyappear in the following if f  y  y  we call Л†f  x  x a lift of f to

p andЛ†П†e  idxwhere Л†П†e denotes the map x  Л†П†e x  Л†П† e xwe remark that l does not imply that p is gequivariant or a gmorphism this is because gequivariance requires x to be a gspace iea manifold with a smooth left action of g on it this in turn means that thelift Л†П† must preserve the group law of g ie cП†gh  Л†П†g Л†П†h we will see shortlythat this is guaranteed only if g is connected if g has several connectedcomponents the lift can give rise to an extension g of the original group bythe deck transformation group d this is described in theorem  thematter of equivariance

the diп¬Ђerent lifts Л†П† of the group action П† to x give rise tothe same cohomology class Оі  h  gd in the dvalued cohomology ong which also implies that the possible group extensions g of g associatedwith these lifts are all equivalent  thus up to equivalence there is onlyone group extension g of g by d and this is basically determined by thegeometry of the covering p  x  y gspaces and equivariant covering mapsalthough property l p Л†П†g  П†gp seems to suggest that every coveringmap p is a gmorphism this is not true in general if g is not connectedfor in this case x is not a gspace but only a gspace as explained abovehowever we can make p equivariant with respect to the larger group g tothis end we п¬Ѓrst note that this requires x and y to be gspaces thiscan be accomplished by introducing the projection pr  g  gd  g andobserving that y is trivially a gspace by deп¬Ѓning the action of g on y asП†  g  y  y П†  П† pr  idy now we must deп¬Ѓne a suitable action Л†П† of g on x

covering projection p is a gmorphismwith respect to the group g where x and y are now regarded as gspaceslet us summarize theorem equivariance of the covering mapdeп¬Ѓne actions П† Л†П† of the extended group g on y x according to formulas  with this deп¬Ѓnition x and y become gspaces and thecovering map p  x  y is gequivariant a gmorphism we now discuss a situation in which a lift Л†П† as introduced in section always exists a glance at formula  in section  shows thatthe lift exists if the fundamental groups of both g and x are trivial nowwe perform the following construction we assume that g is connected andx is simply connectedif g acts on y via П† then so does the universalsimply connected covering group cg of g just let pro  cg  g be thenatural projection which is a homomorphism then cП†  cg  y  y cП†  П† pro  idy  deп¬Ѓnes a smooth left action of cg on y  therefore inll since g is connected formula  in theorem  tells us thatthis case there always exists a liftccП†  cg  x  x

suchthatccП† preserves the group law on cgthus the projection map p is a cgmorphism of cgspacesdcП†gh  ccП†g dcП†hp  ccП†g  cП†g  pfor g  cg a consequence of the developments in this section is this assumethat p  x  y is a smooth covering of manifolds where y is a symplecticmanifold with symplectic form П‰ since p is a local diп¬Ђeomorphism theform П‰  pП‰ is closed and nondegenerate and hence is a valid symplecticform on x now assume that a connected lie group g acts on y via П† g  y  y such that all diп¬Ђeomorphisms П†g are canonical transformationsП†П‰  П‰ assume that a lift П† to x exists as g is connected the grouplaw is then preserved since the lift obeys p  П†g  П†g  p it follows thatП†gpП‰  pП†gП‰ or П†gП‰  П‰ hence all diп¬Ђeomorphisms П†g are canonicaltransformations on the

discussion in section  we know thatt x is itself a covering space of t y  and p as deп¬Ѓned in equation is the covering map hence we can extend the action П† п¬Ѓrst to an action П†on the cotangent

theoremlet g be a connected lie group let p  x  y be a covering where x isconnected let П†  gy  y be a smooth action of g on y  which possessesof the extension П†  gt y  t y of the action П† to the

with bП†cid symplectic gactions and moment mapsin the following sections we generalize the usual deп¬Ѓnition of a moment mapto a construction we call local moment map the standard deп¬Ѓnitions foundin the literature generally involve that a moment map is a globally deп¬Ѓnedfunction from a symplectic manifold m into the coalgebra of the lie algebraof a lie group g which acts on m symplectically eg

or equivalently that the Л†g r are trivialassociated lie algebra cohomoloy groups h in this work we make no assumptions about cohomologies on the group gnor do we assume that moment maps exist

of moment mapsusually moment maps are introduced in a more restricted context for example conditions are imposed from the start so as to guarantee the existenceof a uniquely determined singlevalued globally deп¬Ѓned moment map furthermore it is often assumed that the п¬Ѓrst and second chevalleyeilenbergcohomology groups of the group g vanish which then provides a suп¬ѓcientcondition for the moment map to transform as a gmorphism   ourapproach will be slightly more general the п¬Ѓrst generalization has beenmade above allowing for moment maps to be only locally deп¬Ѓned the second one is that we do not want to enforce the moment maps to behave asstrict gmorphisms rather the deviation from transforming equivariantly isdetermined by a cocycle in a certain cohomology on Л†g which in turn givesrise to a central extension of the original lie algebra Л†g which is interestingin its own right and also physically relevantlet the conditions of theorem  be given reconstruct a simplyconnected

and furthermorethat the lift of П† to x coincides with Л†П†we now introduce trivializations for p  x  y  and subsequently construct preferred trivializations of the coverings r  x  z and q  z  ybased on this firstly let v be a simply connected open cover of y as aboveand let ia  d  va  x be a trivialization of the covering p  x  y given an element d  d let d denote the coset d  h  d where h  dis

connected component s x of j j x that contains x ie s x  j j xis connected in the induced topology and x  s x the collection of alls x as x ranges through x is denoted as Пѓx then Пѓx is an identiп¬Ѓcationspace where s  x  Пѓx is the identiп¬Ѓcation map we endow Пѓx with thequotient topology inherited from x one can assume further technical conditions in order to guarantee that the sets

the п¬Ѓrst thing to observe is that the diffeomorphisms Оі of the deck transformation group d of the covering descendto Пѓx  to see this let О» be a path lying entirely in one of the connected

concept supplying us with all trigonometric polynomial invariantsand their algebraic basis is highly desirable in the case of the rational polynomial invariants the existence of the algebraic basis is guaranteed by chevalleys theorem  thejacobian for the transition from cartesian coordinates in root space to the basic invariants as new coordinates can be factorized factorization theorem both the chevalleytheorem and the factorization theorem are valid also in the trigonometric case as we shallshow here for f for the classical lie algebras and g they are known to be valid tooour construction of invariants proceeds as follows we decompose the root latticeО» into orbits П‰ inп¬Ѓnitely many they can be ordered by the length of vectors which isconstant over the orbit for each orbit we deп¬Ѓne
